# Approaches / Abordagens

Pontos extras que podem ser garantidos (ou requeridos) ao se ter uma interpretação a caráter.

## [[STARGARDEN/LiRe RPG - PTBR/Sistema/Stats/Abordagens/Careful\|Careful]]

> You act with caution, paying attention to the details. When you are holding back, taking your time, making extra special sure you get it right, leaving no opening for counterattack, maintaining situational awareness, buying time, or being guarded in your responses...you are being careful.

## [[STARGARDEN/LiRe RPG - PTBR/Sistema/Stats/Abordagens/Flashy\|Flashy]]

> You act in big showy ways, giving the appearance of sparkling brilliance and ostentatiously draw attention to yourself. Being larger than life is a speciality. When you go big, brazenly proclaim, entertain, seek to impress, bluster your way out of something, show off, or just do things while piling on with extra awesome style...you are being flashy.

## [[STARGARDEN/LiRe RPG - PTBR/Sistema/Stats/Abordagens/Quick\|Quick]]

> You act swiftly and with great agility, fast and sure-footed. When you act without stopping to think, dart and weave, lunge and leap, use quick reflexes to respond in a hurry, squeeze in an extra little non-action, dash through before its too late...you are being quick.

## [[STARGARDEN/LiRe RPG - PTBR/Sistema/Stats/Abordagens/Clever\|Clever]]

> You think quickly, and act with great finesse. When you do 'the smart thing', make intuitive leaps, exploit a nuance or a weakness, outwit or trick, execute choreographed or complex maneuvers, use an opponent's strengths against them, or otherwise rely on your smarts to solve something...you are being clever.

## [[STARGARDEN/LiRe RPG - PTBR/Sistema/Stats/Abordagens/Forceful\|Forceful]]

> You act boldly with no hesitation and without holding back. Both physically and mentally you fully commit to what you are doing and exert yourself to your fullest. When you swing for the fences, throw your shoulder into it, grin and bear it, give it your all, and go all in...you are being forceful.

## [[STARGARDEN/LiRe RPG - PTBR/Sistema/Stats/Abordagens/Sneaky\|Sneaky]]

> You act deceptively, secretively, attempting to avoid notice, in furtive and surreptitious ways. When you try to conceal or hide what you are doing, obscure your intentions, evade detection, appear to be other than what you are, set a trap or lay in ambush...you are being sneaky.
