## Wilderness
The Wilderness skill is the basic know-how for getting by. You can forage for food, distinguish between safe and poisonous foods, follow tracks, start a fire, and create basic tools like fishing lures and nets. Wilderness intersects with several other skills, but is entirely concerned with how you survive the great outdoors. While Wilderness doesn’t include “street smarts,” it is also useful within cities as many of its uses—such as finding or creating shelter, starting fires, and locating food—would also help for surviving city streets.
### Overcome
Wilderness helps you overcome challenges posed by the environment. You can find food and water and notice dangers posed by poisonous plants or certain sounds.
### Create an Advantage
You create advantages by declaring helpful aspects on the environment, such as an Animal Path leading to fresh water, and by adapting the world around you, such as by creating a Shelter. You can also develop tools, such as creating a Net for easier fishing.
### Wilderness Stunts
- **Water Baby**: You know everything there is to know about living in and around the water. +2 to Wilderness when you’re in the same zone as a body of water.
- **Animal Family**: Growing up, you spent a lot of time around animals. Choose a species to declare your animal family. When you encounter a member of that species, you can communicate and request favors using Wilderness.
## Survival
The Survival skill is all about the ability to endure and physically thrive in the wilds, whether in jungle, desert, or even the streets and sewers of a city. It covers situational awareness—your overall perception and the ability to pick out at a glance useful things or dangers hidden in the surrounding environment.
### Overcome
You use Survival to overcome obstacles relating to your environment, such as finding your way through rugged terrain, gathering edible food and potable water, and so on. Survival is also used to overcome obstacles relating to reaction: noticing a danger, hearing a faint sound of someone following you, spotting the concealed gun in that guy’s waistband, etc. Additionally, Survival can be used to treat a physical consequence akin to being a field medic, provided you have the proper supplies and time.
### Create an Advantage
You use Survival to create aspects based on direct observation of your surroundings—finding an escape route in a debris-filled building, noticing someone sticking out in a crowd, tracking an animal or person, etc. When observing people, Survival can tell you what’s going on with them externally; for internal changes, see Empathy. You might also use Survival to declare that your character spots something you can use to your advantage in a situation, such as a convenient Escape Route when you’re trying to get out of a building, or a Subtle Weakness in the enemy’s line of defense. For example, if you’re in a barroom brawl you could make a Survival roll to say that you spot a puddle on the floor right next to your opponent’s feet that could cause him to slip.
Survival also allows you to create aspects based on using or manipulating your environment, such as making a trap or a foxhole, scrounging for supplies, building a shelter or tools, and otherwise altering the environment to suit your needs.
### Attack
Survival isn’t really used for attacks.
### Defend
You can use Survival to defend against any uses of Stealth to get the drop on you or ambush you, or to discover that you’re being observed. Survival is also used to defend against gunfire and other such attacks, but only when you are huddled down in a defensible position, such as a foxhole or bunker. (This is the opposite of using Athletics, which involves avoiding these situations via movement.)
### Special
Survival is used to establish turn order in a physical conflict, replacing Notice.
## Contacts
Contacts is the skill of knowing people and making connections with them, especially in a pinch. The better you are with Contacts, the better your information network.
### Overcome
Poll your social networks for information. Whether that’s old-fashioned “man on the street” type of work or searching archives and computer databases, you’re able to hunt down information (or people). Note that in the case of finding a specific person, a successful roll doesn’t necessarily give you immediate access to them, depending on the situation. For example, if the research scientist in question is currently detained by the authorities, that’ll be a separate obstacle to overcome (maybe using Contacts, maybe using some other skill).
### Create Advantage
Leverage your contacts to create a story detail or create/discover an aspect. “Hey, my contacts tell me that Joe Steel is the Best Mechanic For A Thousand Miles—we should talk to him.”
### Create Advantage
Get the word on the street about a particular individual, object, or location, based on what your contacts tell you. These aspects almost always deal with reputation more than fact, such as Known Sycophant or Notorious Swindler. Whether that person lives up to their reputation is anybody’s guess, though that doesn’t invalidate the aspect. (People often have misleading reputations about themselves that complicate their lives.) Similarly, you can also use your information network to plant information or get you information to help in the conflict.
### Defend
Counter an opponent’s attempts to create social advantages against you, provided your information network can be brought to bear in the situation.
## ?? INT Notice?
An experienced commander looking down on a battlefield will see more than blood and chaos. A true strategist will see opportunities, weaknesses, and—above all—the guiding hand of the opposing general.
### We Have Already Won
Before a physical conflict begins, if you have advance knowledge of the area in which the battle will take place, and you have the opportunity to discuss tactics with allies, you can use Notice to create an aspect on a single zone without actually being there. This aspect represents the benefits of planning and scouting, such as Coordinated Ambush or We’ll Hold Them At This Pass. You can use this stunt for crew battles and for conflicts between individual characters.
### It’s A Trap!
+2 to Notice to detect hidden aspects, such as Concealed Trenches or Snipers Watching, on any zone you can see.
## Medicine
Medicine lets you dress wounds and diagnose problems.
### Overcome
Medicine is used to overcome physical stress and consequences in yourself and others.
### Create an Advantage
Medicine can also be used to set physical weaknesses on your opponents, creating aspects to exploit in a fight.
### Defend
Medicine can defend against poisons.
### Medicine Stunts
- **Cornered**: In close quarters, use Medicine—and supplies from your medical kit—instead of Fight to injure an opponent who attacked you on their previous turn.
- **Trust Me, I’m a Doctor**: If the people you’re interacting with are aware of your medical skills, add +2 to Rapport.
## Navigate
Navigate handles map-reading, backtracking, following directions, finding North, and being able to translate distances into the time, fuel, and supplies needed to traverse them.
### Overcome
Use Navigate if your character is lost. They can retrace their steps, determine North, or navigate by stars or landmarks.
### Create an Advantage
With Navigate, you map your course and can learn about or set aspects along the way. You can also take time to map out a new settlement.
### Navigate Stunts
- **Always Prepared**: You studied the route and anticipated necessary supplies. Once per journey between two settlements, set an aspect with a free invoke that demonstrates this preparation.
- **Back and Safe**: Once per session, spend a fate point to safely and without interruptions return to wherever you’re staying or have recently slept.
## ??
Though modern weapons have transformed the face of warfare, the insights of past battlefield masters such as Sun Tzu and Carl von Clausewitz are critical for the education of any commander.
### Eightfold Formation
From your study of battle formations, you know how to arrange your troops for any situation. During crew combat, you can use Lore instead of Will to benefit units under your command. See the Fate System Toolkit (page 167) for a list of these benefits.
### Empty Fort Strategy
Your knowledge of armies and warfare allows you to construct a convincing illusion on the battlefield. You can use Lore instead of Deceive to create a plausible but untrue situation aspect on a zone. Creating this aspect requires enough time before the enemy arrives to arrange the scene appropriately—creating false tracks, propping up rifles in windows, and so forth.
For instance, you might place Well Garrisoned on an empty building, or Bristling with Traps on an otherwise ordinary road. Enemies who see your illusion attempt to overcome using Notice, with a difficulty equal to the shifts of your Lore roll used to create the illusion. Any enemies who fail this action will believe the aspect is true, and will act accordingly.
## Culture
Culture is the adaptability that makes travel easy and interesting for you. With Culture, you not only know the right clothes and local secrets, you also know how to blend in and how best to insult, shock, scare, or compliment the locals. Culture isn’t how you affect others, but rather how you fit into what people expect or how you demonstrate respect by a show of fitting in.
### Overcome
Use Culture to adjust to a new place and society and to overcome culture shock and other hazards of travel. With Culture, you can blend in as a social chameleon, estimate the layout of a place, and provoke or influence locals.
### Create an Advantage
Use Culture to give yourself temporary aspects that influence how others see and react to you (e.g., Convincingly Authoritative, Using the Right Gestures). You may also use your cultural knowledge to build a better Rapport with or to Deceive people.
### Culture Stunts
- **Polyglot**: You’ve picked up bits and pieces of languages from all over. Add +2 to Culture rolls involving language.
- **You Honor Us**: Gain +2 to a Culture roll after respecting a local custom. After using this skill, you must again demonstrate your respect to reuse it.
## Rapport
A charismatic leader can remove a crew’s fear, doubts, and fatigue with a few well-chosen words.
### Follow Me To Glory!
You are an inspiring presence on the battlefield. You can use Rapport instead of Will to benefit units under your command during crew combat. See the Fate System Toolkit (page 167) for a list of these benefits.
### Good Show!
When you show approval of a job well done, you encourage your allies to achieve greater success. Once per scene, if an ally successfully creates an advantage, you can grant another free invoke on the same aspect if you are close enough to issue encouragement or congratulations. This does not require an action.
## Empathy
Empathy involves knowing and being able to spot changes in a person’s mood or bearing. It’s basically the Notice skill (see below), but for people.
### Overcome
Perceive a change in someone’s attitude or intent.
### Overcome
Remove mental consequences from yourself or others.
### Create Advantage
Read a person’s emotional state and/or get a general sense of who they are. This presumes you have some kind of interpersonal contact with them. Most often, this will mean discovering their aspects, but you can also create new aspects for NPCs as well. If the target has some reason to be aware that you’re trying to read them, they can defend with Deceive or Rapport. This includes the use of Empathy to try and discover what circumstances will allow you to conduct mental attacks against the target by figuring out their breaking points.
### Defend
See through lies and deceptions to someone’s true intent.
### Defend
Counter someone’s attempt to create an advantage against you in a social context. Generally speaking, this usually requires direct contact with them. If you’re working through an intermediary, Contacts is probably a more appropriate skill to use.
## Athletics
The Athletics skill represents your character’s general level of physical fitness, whether through training, natural gifts, or unusual means (like cybernetic enhancement or genetic alteration). It’s the skill that represents how good you are at moving your body.
### Overcome
Deal with an obstacle that requires physical movement—jumping, running, climbing, swimming, etc. If it resembles something you’d do in the decathlon, you should roll Athletics. You’d also roll to participate in any contests or challenges that rely on these types of activities. Note that conflicts aren’t obstacles; those are handled by Defend (see below).
### Create Advantage
Maneuver to gain an edge, such as finding Higher Ground, forcing someone to be Cornered, or climbing a tree to get a Bird’s Eye View.
### Defend
Dodge close-quarters or ranged attacks in a physical conflict.
### Defend
Counter efforts to create an advantage against you, if you’re in a position to physically interfere with whomever’s making the attempt, or to keep someone from moving past a certain point.
## Physique
### Discover
Use Physique to ask questions about physical training, exercise equipment, and your own body. Ask questions about your physical limits and abilities, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of physical objects. You can also gain information about the world through physical tests using Physique, e.g., how much does this thing weigh?
## Fortitude
Mental fortitude, the ability to overcome temptation and to withstand trauma. Will stunts let you ignore mental consequences, withstand the mental agony of strange powers, and hold steady against enemies who provoke you. In addition, a high Will rating gives you more mental stress or consequence slots (page 12).
## Will
### Discover
Use Will to learn more about the mental defenses of others—especially when you see them tried and tested—and, through reflection and concentration, recall what you may have overlooked. Discovering information with Will may also be possible in contests of mental strength, like interrogating a difficult witness.
## Commander
A ship’s captain must be decisive and determined, or else risk losing the faith of the crew.
### Master and Commander
Once per scene, when your crew or battle unit performs a single action under your command, you can substitute your Will for any skill the crew or unit would have used. This Will roll cannot be improved with teamwork bonuses.
### One With the Ship
Your sweat and blood keeps the ship going in the worst circumstances. When the ship would take a consequence, your character can instead choose to take an equivalent consequence.
## Will
### Discover
Use Will to learn more about the mental defenses of others—especially when you see them tried and tested—and, through reflection and concentration, recall what you may have overlooked. Discovering information with Will may also be possible in contests of mental strength, like interrogating a difficult witness.
## Provoke?
Fear and anger can be effective tools for driving a crew to perform extraordinary feats.
### Have At Them, You Dogs!
You keep your troops motivated in combat by bellowing a constant stream of colorful, inventive, and multi-lingual insults. You can use Provoke instead of Will to benefit units under your command during crew combat. See the Fate System Toolkit (page 167) for a list of these benefits.
### Iron Grip
Your crew is too afraid of you to keep any secrets from you. You can use Provoke instead of Empathy to detect changes in the crew’s mood or to discover any secrets or plots the crew is hiding from you.
## Provoke
### Discover
Provoke lets you learn more about your opponent’s strengths and weaknesses, but in a social sphere instead of a physical one. Use Provoke to ask questions about how people react to specific stimuli, spotting reactions that might not be immediately apparent. Note that you need to differentiate Provoke and Empathy; the latter provides much richer information about the intent and emotions of the target.
Ability to push people to act the way you want them to. It’s coarse and manipulative, not a positive interaction. Provoke stunts let you push opponents into foolhardy action, draw aggression toward you, or scare enemies (assuming they can feel fear).
## Crafts
Ability to make or break machinery, build contraptions, and pull off MacGyver-esque feats of ingenuity. Crafts stunts let you have the gizmo on hand, give bonuses to building and breaking things, and provide justification for using Crafts in place of skills like Burglary or Academics under certain circumstances.
### Discover
Use Crafts to learn about the properties, strengths, and weaknesses of various objects. You might use it to learn about how a building or device was constructed, to find out what materials were used to make an object, or to discover who made a particular item, assuming the creator would leave telltale evidence. You may need additional scientific equipment or time with an object to use this action with Crafts.
## Mechanics
Mechanics is the knowledge of machines and making things go. Mechanics can build and repair engines, design traps or locks, and understand the interaction of different physical forces. It’s the skill of engineers and physicists.
### Overcome
Mechanics allows you to build, break, or fix machines and engines, provided you have tools and time. You can also pick locks.
### Create an Advantage
Mechanics allows you to notice the strengths and weaknesses of a system. You can point out these aspects to your advantage. You can also fix or sabotage a machine under pressure.
### Mechanics Stunts
- **Above and Beyond**: Once per session, add an extra aspect with one free invoke to a machine you’re repairing.
- **Trap Master**: Your traps require three Good rolls against passive opposition. You can spend up to three fate points increasing each requirement from Good to Great.
## Construction
Construction is the skill of building objects with any material. Characters skilled in Construction are the builders, architects, and designers.
### Overcome
Construction is a more limited version of the default Crafts skill and allows you to build, break, or fix objects, provided you have tools and time.
### Create an Advantage
With Construction you can point out aspects of an object, both positive and negative. You can also use Construction to make or sabotage objects on the fly or to strengthen defenses.
### Construction Stunts
- **Bearing Gifts**: Create a present for someone you’re trying to influence. Use an aspect to describe how the person feels toward you afterward (e.g., Thankful).
- **Prison Break**: Whenever you’re being detained, spend a fate point and escape.
## Deceive
As might be expected, this is the skill of lies and misdirection. Whether spinning a convincing falsehood, crafting a disguise, or bluffing some poor dope who really ought to know better, it’s all Deceive.
### Overcome
Bluff or give a false impression. These are situations in which the stakes aren’t high enough for a contest or conflict, but you still want to roll to see if things get complicated or not. More complicated cons might involve a contest or a challenge, as you layer the deception to achieve your goal.
### Overcome
Create a convincing disguise, whether for yourself or others. You’ll need to have the time and supplies to create the desired effect.
### Create Advantage
Obtain information from someone who (falsely) believes you to be trustworthy. This is more likely to get you story details than an aspect, but if the information represents a tangible advantage, it might net you an aspect.
By a similar token, the advantage might be an aspect you’re putting forward as a false impression. For example, if you’re undercover at a fancy corporate shindig, you might use Deceive to declare a Wealthy Industrialist Cover Story on the scene to help you mingle with the guests.
### Create Advantage
Distract or misdirect, similar to declaring a false impression above. This can also apply in physical conflicts for feints and fake-outs, allowing you to put an enemy Off-Balance.
### Defend
Counter efforts to discern your true motives. This includes someone using Empathy against you, as well as throwing off investigation attempts with false information.
## Deceive
The art of deception can be a useful—if not necessarily honorable—talent for a ship’s captain.
### Subtle Signaling
By understanding the relationship between lantern signals and the hexagrams of the I Ching, you can construct signals that carry hidden significance. To understand the hidden message, an observer must have the Subtle Signaling stunt or must successfully overcome with Lore, opposed by your Deceive.
### The Finest Snake Oil
You’ve learned enough scientific jargon to convince people that the flasks of colored vinegar you’re selling are elixirs of youth or miracle cure-alls. +2 to Deceive while trying to convince someone that you’ve produced a remarkable feat of alchemy.
## Pilot
The Pilot skill gets you from point A to B in every way except walking. It is flying airplanes, spaceships, and zeppelins, driving cars and trains, sailing and rowing boats, and riding bicycles and horses. If it moves, you can operate it.
### Overcome
Pilot is used to maneuver through or over a space. The skill allows characters to get through poor conditions (e.g., storms, tight spaces, rough seas) and to show off. It can also be used for contests.
### Attack
Pilot is not typically used for attacking. You can, however, use your vehicle as a weapon by crashing or ramming into another object to cause stress. You incur as much stress as you cause and must complete a second roll to determine whether your vehicle remains viable. Your second roll must be equal to or greater than the stress you caused to remain usable.
### Defend
You can defend against attacks from similar vehicles to whatever one you are piloting by dodging, weaving, and making other clever movements.
### Pilot Stunts
- **Experience Counts**: Roll Pilot instead of Mechanics or Construction to fix a vehicle your character is familiar with.
- **This Is My Domain**: Choose Air, Water, or Land and add +2 to all Pilot rolls that involve a vehicle operating in that space.
## Drive
### Discover
Use Drive to learn more about vehicles and the evidence they leave behind or to judge speed and distance while driving. You can also locate the quickest or safest route to a destination or find the correct parts or gear to get a vehicle up and running again.
### Drive
Controlling vehicles under the most grueling circumstances, pulling wicked maneuvers, and simply getting the most out of your ride. Drive stunts can be signature maneuvers, a special vehicle of your own, or the ability to use Drive in place of a skill like Burglary or Academics under certain circumstances.
