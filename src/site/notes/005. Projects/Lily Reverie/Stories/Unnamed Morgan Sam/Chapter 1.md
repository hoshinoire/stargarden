*Ting-a-ling!*

"Hello, hello! What brings you to my dusty little store of old things?"

The store owner friendly says the line that's nearly second nature for her at this point. Much did she wonder, how many times has she said it? This instance wasn't the case, however: she's very far from the point you'd still wonder about that kind of thing. Even more so since she realized the futility of attempting to count it, as she forgot the amount every single time. Her eyes and hair color were both ruby-colored, her outfit was akin to a steampunk one and her hair was tied in a side ponytail.

The customer that so entered the establishment walked towards the balcony, observing every nook and crane of the store in silence. She had a long orange hair, tied up in a ponytail, wore fishnets, a green fur jacket, black boots, a large backpack and a black crop top. Her eyes were bright yellow. Very sharp eyes, the store owner noted to herself, hopefully mentally. Her boots emitted loud noises, her steps almost heavy in nature. The redhead noted to herself, once again hopefully mentally, that the girl had a very particular way of carrying herself. It even reminded her of something else, but she couldn't quite put her finger on it. Nevertheless, she kept smiling, waiting for her client.

The booted girl, whose appearance didn't fit in an antique store in the slightest, rubbed her nose.

"Well, you aren't lying, it's dusty alright." She made a disgruntled expression. If she spent more time here, she'd end up sneezing, she thought.

"Cleaning is not my forte~" For a second, she almost did a '_teehee_' kind of expression, but that client had too much of an intimidating aura and made her go stiff. Oh, no. She even got reminded of the times she used to have social anxiety, times she thought were long over. Yet she managed to snap herself back to the store right now.

"Yeah." She shrugged and looked around some more. "You also weren't lying about these things being old... Fucking hell, is this a museum? So much ancient crap around here."

The redhead winced, although almost immediately she managed to hide her expression and set it back to the polite smile. "...Hey, don't call these 'ancient crap'."

"Why? Is it not that?" She reached the balcony, standing near the store owner, size difference now very visible: not only was she tall, the store owner was somewhat of a short lady. She chuckled to herself.

"Oh, would you like it if I talked like so about the oldest piece of antique I've seen during my lifetime? I believe it's very dear to you."

"Eh? What the fuck are you talking about? Get to the point." She tilted her head, confused.

"Exactly like I said, the oldest antique I've ever seen I'm sure matters a lot to you, that's why you shouldn't call other antique 'ancient crap'. You want me to call your mother 'ancient crap'?" She smugly said, feeling proud of her comeback. She contained the initial wince, but in the end, she couldn't truly contain herself. After all, the reason she ended up in fights in the past was always her mouth.

"...Ha?" She narrowed her eyes and raised her left cheeks, tilting her head and leaning in closer to the girl at the other side of the balcony, who gulped, and then angrily opened her mouth. "My mother is dead, are you saying you practice necrophilia?"

"Sometimes love and lust can't be contained by the limits of the mortal realm! During that night of our rendezvous, right at that moment her cold body felt oh-so-warm in my embrace... Your mom was a wonderful, lady, a wonderful compa--" Wait! Darn blabbermouth, she thought to herself, that's actually awfully rude to say, that wasn't supposed to be voiced! Preparing herself to receive a punch on the face, she lamented mistaking her internal monologue and what she was actually saying, a very common occurrence. "I'm sorry! The words just got out of my mouth, I'm actually really sorry for your loss!"

The tall girl further narrowed her eyes and leaned in even more, her expression and body language completely intimidating, as if emanating an aura of physical aggression, as the other girl thought, who also just then figured out that the orange-haired girl reminds her of delinquents. She leaned in even more, now basically face to face with the redhead, and sharply looked at her face, noticing her quick breath and the eyes resisting the impulse to dart around, tension and fear almost palpable. And observing was the only thing she did, as she remained in silence, perhaps even more intimidatingly so.

"A-and I didn't have any sexual relationship with your mother, during her time alive or not, that was just some attempt of a comeback! Which I thought was pretty good, but! I'm truly sorry!"

The other girl did a puff and flicked the redhead's forehead, leaning back and doing a loud, hearty laugh. "You don't need to explain, I know what a 'your mom' joke is. Pfft..." She went back to laughing, even holding her stomach.

The store owner froze and went blank at that moment. She was already making plans of swapping her shift so other customers wouldn't see her punched face! But miraculously, today was not the day.

"By the way, ahah, my 'ancient crap' is alive and doing well, I had a nice dinner with her yesterday, in fact... Ahha.. Ahaha!" She mustered her strength so she could make a complete sentence amidst all her laughter. "And I don't give a fuck if that'd be rude, I'm rude as shit too and that was good, kiddo! I like you already! You... You're hilarious! Aha.. Hahaha!"

She went back to laughing. The store owner, meanwhile, was slowly composing herself and looking at the laughter with an almost unfazed face. She wanted to make a mean comment, even if internally, maybe call it immature, but she couldn't. She knew all too well the ecstasy of the delinquent, she was in her position in all too many times already and she's still not above pulling that kind of thing. No, no. Instead, she felt almost some fraternity with the other girl now. But she was still in too much shock to open her usually hyperactive mouth and say anything.

"Ohh, also, chill down, kiddo. I don't mean any disrespect calling these ancient crap, I just talk like this about everything!" Finally, a calmer laugh. She also did a thumbs up. "Otherwise... I wouldn't be here, eh? Well, I guess I'd, considering why I AM here, but..."

"A-ah. Why are you here, then?"

"Did I go too hard? Take your time getting back to normal." She said in an almost smug tone of voice. "Well, aaanyway. Getting to the point. I'm the one who made that post about a random object found and you said to come to your store because it's supposedly some super special and rare bullshit. So, here I am. Hope the pay is as good as that little prank was."

"Oh! That was you?" Hearing that brought back all her usual energy, no, she was feeling way more energetic than usual right now. The other girl chuckled seeing her perk up like that. "Show me, show me!"

"Give me a sec." She started messing with her backpack, looking for it. "There's also some other junk I found, uh, I'm just gonna put everything on your balcony while I don't find it..."

She nodded, looking at the objects slowly piling up on her balcony and her eyes quickly beaming up with glee, darting like crazy, incapable of deciding a single one to pay more attention to. "Where did you find all these things?!"

"Ha? Same as the one I'm here for." Finally finding the one thing she was actually looking for, she also put it on the balcony and then closed her backpack. "Abandoned houses and buildings, all that jazz. Trespassing, basically."

"Ooohh!" She couldn't contain herself and her hands started messing with each of the objects there, not just the main attraction. The other girl couldn't help but think she looked like an excited little kid having the time of her life and once again chuckled.

"Heh, thought you'd complain about the trespassing. People like you usually are goody-two-shoes."

Now, it was the turn of the other girl to loudly laugh. "Ha! If it weren't for your trespassing, or of many before you, such relics would forever be lost! And for no good reason! Sometimes laws just make no goddamn sense and just hinder progress and joy, is what I always say!" She said, not looking at the orange-haired girl for a single second, her gaze and attention so fixated on fiddling with the objects in front of her the fact her sentence made any sense was surprising. "And never assume too much, you're probably more of a goody-goody than me~"

"Keep dreaming, kiddo." She laughed and nodded to herself, seeing that the two would, in fact, get along very well. Now, she got quiet and deep in thought, attentively observing the short girl excitedly messing with all the... things, objects, junk, crap, whatever the word. All the bullshit, is how she summed it up before sneezing. "...Ah, yeah, kiddo? Name's Sam. Or Samantha, but who fucking cares?"

For the first time in quite a few minutes, the redhead looked up, right at Sam. "Oh! Name's Morgan." Aaand back to paying attention to her so prized relics she went.
