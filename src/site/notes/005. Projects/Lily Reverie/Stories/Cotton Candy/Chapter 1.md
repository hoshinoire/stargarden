Look at that hair, man. That fluffy, pink hair. It’s so cute. It reminds me of cotton candy. I wish I could take a bite of that hair. I wonder if the texture is similar…?

_Damn, now I feel an urge to eat cotton candy._

“Ms. Thana, it’s the fourth time today. Would you please pay attention to class? Or do you wish to go to detention?” said the teacher with long, fluffy pink hair. Similarly to a centaur, her lower body was that of an alpaca. She also had alpaca ears on her head and shiny, pretty blue eyes.

“Oh.” _Fuck. She has such a soft appearance and normally acts so sweet… I end up forgetting she manages to be so strict._ “I’m sorry.”

The one apologizing was a girl with a messy, lavender witheish hair tied into two braids over her shoulders. She also used dark sunglasses.

_I’ll just have to fake that I’m paying attention, I guess. Whatever._

_But that teacher is pretty cute, isn’t she? Sure, her hair is ultra fluffy, but she has a cute face, too. Heck, in a way, being part alpaca is cute. Her lower part being an animal is cute. Actually, I wonder… Is her vagina on the back or the front? Is it shaved or a bush of fluff? Cotton candy… Heh… …Wait, wait, let’s… Not go there! Guess I went overboard quick._

_Still._

_She is cute. Hella cute._

Her thoughts so went on.

“Thana.” the teacher said, as strict as always.

“OH CRAP, sorry~” she apologized. “I was thinking about a cutie~” _Do you think if she knew the cutie I’m talking about is her she would blush? Gosh, I wonder how she would react._ “…So, uh. It’s… Detention for me?”

“Look around you and take a guess.”

The classroom was empty. There was just Thana and the teacher there. Everyone left.

“Wait, class ended already? Wait wait wait, I didn’t even remember yours was the last one for the day, Ms. Lana… Oh, damn.” She scratched her head. _Woosh, that was a great spacing out. Maybe on my top ten of the week, heh?_ “Detention, huh…”

“No, no, calm down. Just wanted to remind you class ended, is all.” She sounded a bit sweeter this time. Surely, the girl could still sense a certain strictness in her tone, but it was way softer. Maybe there was no strictness at this point at all, and she just assumed she was being strict because, well, Lana.

“Oooh, really?! Really?! Thanks!” A bright smile from a creature of the night. _Cha fucking Risse, I’m so relieved. My mother doesn’t really care that much at this point, but… I would rather avoid trouble._

“It’s fine, class was already over.” She smiled back at her. A soft and delicate smile. _OOF. Did we just do a complete 180? She’s super nice now. And her smile is, like, totally adorable._ “…But, I want to talk to you for a bit. Is that alright?” _Oh boy._

“O-Oh. Sure.” _I’m fucked. Will this be a interrogation? Will she say things to mother? Will I have to make up for my spacing out? Fuck. But, well! You know! There’s a slight chance that she finds me an interesting person and simply wants to talk with me! All possibilities should be taken into account, right? So… Yeah. Wait, aren’t we getting some time alone…? Ohohoh._ “What is it?”

“Multiple topics, actually. But I’ll talk first about the one that is bugging me right now.” She messed with her hair, a slight tint of red appearing on her cheeks. “You keep spacing out looking at me. And you make that weird face… I, um… I want to understand why that is…? I can see you being a noturnal creature having to endure day classes making you space out and get sleepy, but that’s not a face of a sleepy person at all…”

_Oh shit._

_You know. I can make up an excuse on the spot. ‘Lana, you remind me of my mother!’ Wait, shit, this won’t work, she knows my mother. Fuck. ‘I was daydreaming! That is my daydream face!’ ‘You look like my SO!’ ‘I like alpacas and you remind me of cotton candy’. Okay, those work just fine. But man. I’m tempted now. Tempted to say the truth, maybe even exaggerate it a bit. I want to push her buttons. Her cute buttons. Fuck, I’m gonna do it. I’ll take a gambit. My reputation is crappy anyways, I’ve got nothing to lose. This will be fun~_

“Oh, you see~” She crossed her legs and put her hand on her chin. Her expression was a mixture of flirty and of a prankster about to pull a prank. Lana gulped. “You remember I mentioning thinking about a cutie?”

“Y-yes. Do I perhaps remind you of he- I mean, that so called cutie..?” She asked, mildly bashfully. Everyone knew Thana attracted females and flirted with them. Her interest in females was old news by now. _Eeeh, so even the new teachers know it now? Hmmm…_

“You aren’t wrong, but… You aren’t right, either. Come a bit closer~” The expression was increasingly flirtier.

“No.” She was embarrassed, but she was firm all the same. Actually, she even got a bit away from her. _What a shame. I wanted put my hand on her chin and then caress her hair while I smoothly compliment her. That gets all girls wet, ya know? Aw, phooey. I gotta deal with the cards I was dealt._

“Fine, fine. That’s okay.” She calmly said. “Would you please pay attention, though?”

“Of course.” She gulped once again. In a way, Lana knew what sort of thing was coming. There is no way this one little pest, known for many things, including stealing ladies’ hearts, would act this flirty without it meaning anything.

_“Weeeell~” Thana looked down at her desk, put her hands at it and got up. Standing up, she slowly approached the teacher, wearing a smirk on her face. The teacher tried to slowly get away, until she bumped at the wall. The bat girl’s movements were quick, then: she hastily hit the wall with both her hands, one at each side of Lana, who was now surrounded by the mischievous girl’s wings and the girl herself. The older woman was surprised, but also extremely embarrassed and was more pink than her own hair. “Let’s just say…” Thana put her hands on Lana’s chin, with her faces slowly getting closer. “The cutie is you, sweetie~” And she touched her lips with her own lips._

_So nice, maan.~_

_Wait, fuck. That wouldn’t work out. I don’t think I’d be able to kabedom an alpaca. I’ll need to do this in a normal way. What a shame._

The student got up from her chair and, finally standing, tried getting closer to the teacher, but seeing as Lana tried to get away, the bat decided to just sit on a desk closer to her. Sitting on it, she crossed her legs . “Well, you know~” She put her index finger on her lips. “The cutie I was talking about was you, Lana~”

Lana flinched for some seconds and got redder than she was before. The flinch and embarrassment didn’t last long, though, and certainly less than Thana hoped for. “I-I expected that.” She said, a bit bashfully, but not too much. “I, um, appreciate the compliment and the answer. Now, about the other things I wanted to talk to you about…”

_Aw. Not effective at all. Well, it’s not like it’s more than just some mild attraction to her, heh. She’s cute, sure, but yeah._

The bat got back to a normal position, sitting comfortably on the desk. “What is it, hmm?”

“Have you heard about the socialization club that’s going to start next week? The one that some people are being summoned to?”

_What. The. Heck. What does this even have to do with me? I don’t like where this is going…_ “Yes, I know about it. It sometimes pops up in gossip I overhear. So?”

“We are summoning misfits, and-” _Oh, for fuck’s sake. My reputation is shitty, but I’M NOT a misfit._

“I’m not a misfit. I hang out everyday with Medea and the others. Why would this club have anything to do with me?” She outright interrupted the teacher out of annoyance, and pouted. “Wait, I got it. You want me and my amazing social skills to help the people with no social skills, right? And even though I have good grades, this is a sort of punishment for the way I act in class, right?” _Shit, I got too worked up. I shouldn’t have interrupted her._

“…At least let me finish first, will you?” The softness in her voice seemed to disappear. Or maybe that was just Thana’s mind. _Shit._ “It’s nothing of the sort. We are summoning misfits, yes, but we are also summoning especially notorious troublemakers. And you are one of the most famous of them, Ms. Thana.”

“Still, why am I being dragged to this drag of a club? I socialize pretty well, there is no reason for me to be summoned. Seriously, why? It really is a punishment, isn’t it?” _Dragged to this drag of a club… Hahah. But seriously, this is a fucking drag. Fuck off._

Lana sighed. “Basically all your friend group was summoned. It won’t be too much trouble, you’ll just chat with your friends and sometimes do activities like… Going out. That’s it. It won’t be such a drag as you think. And you aren’t in any clubs, are you?” _Stop avoiding my questions, holy shit._

“But I don’t want to be forced to do this! Even if my friends are there, c’mon! And for Charisse’s sake, why the hell? I. Socialize. Well. I don’t need this club. And stop avoiding my questions!”

“What do I need to say to stop you from whining…? Listen, I’m not the one who decided to summon you. I was only asked to summon you. Don’t complain to me about this stuff.” The alpaca was getting increasingly annoyed.

“But I-” Thana as about to complain once more, but she was interrupted.

“Don’t.” Once again, Lana sighed. This time, the sigh was more intense. “Sheesh, I don’t believe I’ll need to resort to that…” She said to herself, very quietly. “Want to be let in something? The teacher who will take care of the club will be… Me. You’ll spend a lot of lighthearted time with me, Ms. Thana. You said you think I’m, ahem, a cutie, right? So there. We might even be friends. Happy now?” Her tone was sly. Her face certainly was, too.

_Wait wait wait wait. What the… Hell? Is she… Using what I said against myself? Is she using my flirty nature against myself? What the fuck, I’ve never seen a woman do that before. And I certainly didn’t expect the sweet but strict teacher to have such a sly side. Seriously, who would have thought?_

_Ho. I like this. My interest… Has been piqued._ Thana stopped for a few seconds, and then answered. “Yes.”

Lana did a final sigh, but now out of relief. “Good.” Not only Thana stopped whining, her trump card didn’t go to waste. Especially since it was a trump card she would rather not have used. “You only need to attend one time per week, but we will have meetings all days of the week right after class.” _What about food? I get hungry after class…_ “We will meet on the rooftop. If it rains or something, we will… Come to exactly this classroom, okay? And then decide another place.” _Rain isn’t even the worst thing… The sun is way worse, they should just go to classrooms right away…_

“Rooftop…? I’m sensitive to sunlight, you know…” She pouted.

“Then we will meet on this classroom and decide another place. Alright?” _Teacher is quick to make up new plans, huh? Didn’t put up a fight at all. Still… Basically changing the meeting place just because of me… Eh…_ “So it would be fine, I think. Sunlight wouldn’t be a problem.”

“Oh, wow, really?” Lana nodded in confirmation. “Thank you sooo much!” The big grin was back. Joyful, bright and full of life. It was a pretty smile. Thana got up and was standing again. “Can I, like, just give you a hug…? I swear I won’t do anything weird!” _This is my chance…? Heheh._

“No, I refuse.” _Fuck._ “Well, that is the end of things I absolutely needed to talk to you about today. I’ll take my leave, now.” She started walking towards the door, her alpaca lower body doing all the movements.

“Wait, I want to ask something!” Lana looked towards Thana. “What about food? After class I always get hungry!”

“Oh, that. You eat with your friends. That’s it.”

“I see… Well, thanks!” She thanked Lana with her smile. Not a big grin, like before, but a small and sweet smile. _Maybe to this smile she will react?_

“No problem.” She tilted her head, smiling back at her with a somewhat angelical expression on her face. _Too bright! Too bright!_ After that, she went back to what she was doing, and reached the door. “Have a good day. Bye bye.” She waved.

“Bye byee~” She waved back at the alpaca.

Already leaving, the alpaca came back for a second. “Wait, didn’t you say you get hungry after class? Aren’t you hungry now?”

“Hm? Yeah, I said that. I’m still not hungry today, honestly…” A smirk entered her face. _Will she get what I’ll say?~_ “This time, I just have an urge for cotton candy, is all.~”

“Cotton… Candy…?” _Here it comes, here it comes! The ultra embarrassment! I’ve been waiting for this!_ “I think around this time there is someone selling cotton candy on the park near here.” _FUCK. Did she not get it? I don’t think she is very dense, though… She is too sly to not notice that, I think. Maybe she is not part of the majority who likes women? But even so, she seems smart enough to understand… Maybe she just ignored me… Aw, man._

“I-I see. Thank you.” It was an awkward smile.

She looked at Thana’s face of disappointment. “I hope you will enjoy the cotton candy there, it’s pretty good.” It was a soft smile, once again, but this time, it quickly turned into a mischievous one. “It’s not really the cotton candy you want, but I really hope you will enjoy it. It’s the one you CAN have, after all.” She let out a slight chuckle. Thana just stared at her, kind of reactionless. “Well, bye for real now.” And Lana left, the empty classroom now only with Thana.

_…_

_What the fuck is up with this woman…? Seriously…_
