“So, are you after a girl again?” Medea said bluntly and indifferently, her chin resting on her right hand while looking at the girl who sat right in front of her, who was clearly distracted, blushing slightly and doing a creepy smile.

The girl didn’t reply. Or rather, didn’t even listen.

_Yep, jackpot. This is a better confirmation than her actually answering “yes”. Aaand here we go again… I’ve been through this so many times already…_

The two girls were hanging out in a cafe close to school and were sharing a table.

“Thaaaaaana.” She raised her right arm and touched Thana’s cheek with her index finger.

“Eh?! W-what’s it?” The bat girl finally snapped out of her thoughts, surprised with the aracne. Meanwhile, Medea sighed.

“I said. You’ve obsessed with someone again, haven’t you?”  
“Ah… You’ve noticed already?” Thana blushed, scratching her own head.

_This is unusual. Thana? Embarrassed? Pffft._

“You’re damn obvious, you know.” Medea chuckled a bit. “And I’ve seen this too many times, think I wouldn’t recognize it right away?”

“I-is that so… Ahaha…” The bat went silent.

_Yeah. Something definitely is up. Thana isn’t shy with that stuff._

“So, who is your new obsession? Or prey, whatever you call it.”

“Umm… Not someone you know.”

“Oh? Then, what species is she? And where do you know her from?”

“It’s… it’s a secret.”

“My, the official thot of our school has suddenly turned into a pure maiden? Being that shy and secretive isn’t like you.” _Now I’m actually intrigued to know what the hell is going on._

“Mean!” Thana quickly answered. “Okay, okay, let’s just say I have my own reasons to not want to say who the girl is. Is that enough?”

_C’mon, Thana. You know my answer to that one._

“Ehehe, of course not~” Medea answered, mischievously. “It’s someone you can’t tell me you’re into because you’re embarrassed about it?”

“Pretty much.”

“Hm, I see…” Medea nodded. _Oh, I know the perfect bait for the moment._ “I feel happy you see me in that way, Thana, but sadly I’ve gotta turn you down. I’m already in love with my ficional girlfriend. I’m sorry!” The aracne bluntly answered.

“It’s not you, you idiot! I’ve got no feelings of this sort for you!” Thana pouted.

_She is way too easy to tease, ahaha._

“Oh no… Despite you always saying you’re only into girls, you got charmed by a boy?!”

“Of course not! I only like girls, you know that!” _Today is being a goldmine, heh._

“Then, Dahlia?”

“Nah, no feelings like that for her either.”

“Then, you’re into Dahlia’s sister? I think Daryl was her name…” She chuckled. “I can see why you would want to keep that hidden… But don’t worry, your secret is well hidden with me! I won’t tell anyone!” Medea did a thumbs up.  _3, 2, 1…_

“Idiot!” _See? Too easy to mess with._ “I’m not into Daryl or whatever’s her name.”

“Hmm, then…”

“Can’t we talk about anything else? Like, maybe how annoying that club will be?” Thana tried changing the conversation topic.

Medea stayed silent.

_Oh. Maybe… Oh Mag, if I’m right…_

“You got the hots for a teacher?”

“HUH?! O-of course not… Are you crazy, Medea?” Thana immediately denied it and blushed profusely.

*OH NO OH NO OH NO OH NO OH NO.*  
*AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA.*

“Probably, but I’m pretty I’m less crazy than you.” She answered, holding in her urge to laugh. “Really, Thana? You are after a teacher AGAIN? You’re fucking kidding me, right?”

“Uuugh, shut up, Medea…”

“Alright, alright, I’ll hold in my urge to make fun of you.” Medea said. “I imagine you won’t tell me who she is… So tell me, why are you into her?”  
“Oooh, sure!” Thana smiled. “Wait, but are you okay with hearing me gushing about her? You usually dislike those talks.”

_Is she miraculously trying to be considerate? Wow. She usually never asks, starts rambling about a girl and I decide to hear music on my earphones._

“Trust me, this is the only time in my life I’m actually interested. Probably the last time, too. Free all your gushing, Thana. Go, go, go!”

“OKAY!” She inhaled.

_Here we go._
