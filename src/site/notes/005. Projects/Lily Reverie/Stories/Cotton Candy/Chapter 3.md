“So, like. I’ve always thought she was super pretty and had a very cute appearance. I mean, she is just sooo fluffy, oh man. And her hair has such a pretty color. Also, she has nice boobs.” Medea paid attention with a bored look while Thana was obviously gushing and had a happy but creepy expression on her face. “Then, someday I decided to hit on her! She is such a cutie, if it worked it would be so nice. But holy shit, dude. She is unlike any girl I’ve been with.”

“Wait, you ACTUALLY seduced the teacher?!” _That aside, thanks for obviously be talking about Ms. Lana and not even noticing how obvious you are being. And thinking about it, she sure was talking a bit more than normal about Lana. I can’t imagine her accepting Thana’s bullshit, though…_ 

“No… I wish.” Thana sighed. “She somehow refused all my advances and used them against me. And I’m pretty sure she had no interest in me…” She did a slightly sad face. _Of course, you doofus. Well, I’m relieved._ “But really, I’m pretty used to someone not being interested in me as well. But actually using that fact against me?! How? Holy shit.”

_Hmm. This situation still isn’t right._

“I see.” She put a hand on her chin once again. “So she has that hard to get appeal and this is driving you nuts?”

“Ehh… Nah. I mean, she has that appeal, I guess, but she has zero interest, it’s not a hard to get one. She is not… What do you usually call those? Like a tsundere? Uhh…” She scratched her chin while blushing a little. “Also, I don’t really have a thing for those hard to get girls, ahaha. But I guess she got me intrigued…”

“That’s what I was thinking. You usually give up as soon as the girl has little to none interest in you. Yet she made you so intrigued you are finally charmed by the idea of a hard to get girl and you still want to try to bang the teacher?”

“Y-yeah. I guess that’s basically it.” She blushed a bit more.

_“That’s it” my fucking spinneret. Thinking better about it, her shyness because “it’s weird” is totally out of place, this is not the first time she gets interested in a teacher._

_Wait. Could it be…?_

“Hey, Thana. You’ve been thinking about La– ahem, the teacher, several times a day?”

_Her unusual secretiveness…_

“Huh? Yep, I guess.”

_Her unusual amount of blushing and shyness…_

“And that’s happening for how many days?”

_Her way of talking about Lana…_

“Um. There probably a week or so.”

_Her being intrigued and still interested, despite what is usually an instant turn-off for her…_

“And you feel kind of weird around her or when you see her?”

_3, 2, 1…_

“Y-yeah.”

_I knew it._

“Congratulations, Thana! You’re actually falling for someone instead of just wanting to get in their pants for the first time in your life.” She did a mischievous smile. “Who would’ve thought that when love reached you, you would be such a pure maiden? Love sure is a force to be reckoned with.~”

_Heh. My earlier joke was right, in the end. She, of all people, is turning into a pure maiden._

“HUH?! No, no, of course not. I-I just want to bang her, okay?!” She pouted, basically turning into a blushing mess at that moment.

Medea ignored Thana.

“Never thought I’d see the day Thana actually falls for someone. Wew.”

“I-I said, I’m not falling for her! This is purely sexual, okay?!” She pouted, again. “U-uh, shouldn’t Dahlia be here already?”

“Yeah, she should, but she is always late to everything. A shame, really, it’d be really fun if she was here to see such a rare scene.” Medea lamented, still messing with Thana. “Wonder if I tell her the news, she will get here already?”

“Stoooooooop. We’re supposed to be a group that seems like bullies, and not be a group where you bully me!”

_You know, that situation is fucking ridiculous. She never ceases talking about her carpet munching, but now she is so shy._

“C’mon, Thana. You know I’ve always had a penchant for bullying you.” She giggled. “Well, that side of you sure is surprising. Ever stopped to think that Lana might get into you being so shy?”

“You think so? Hmm, may– WAIT, WHY DO YOU KNOW IT’S HER?”

“You’re obvious.” She said, pretty bluntly.

“Uwah… I really need to try to turn into someone less obvious…”

A third girl reached the desk. She had horns and a long, dark green hair. She also had pink eyes.

“Oh, you two are already here? Heyo.” She sat on a free space between Medea and Thana.

_Ehehehe. Time to tell her the news. This will be fun._

“FINALLY!” Thana smiled. “Yo, Dahlia!”

“Hey there.” Medea waved to Dahlia.

Dahlia smiled back to both of them. “So, what are you guys talking about? Seemed like a fun conversation.”

“Nothing at all! Ahaha…” Thana quickly said.

“Thana wants to bang one of our teachers.” And just as Thana said that, Medea immediately replied.

“Oh.” Dahlia said, a bit surprised but not too much.

“It gets worse. She’s actually falling for her and being super shy.”

“…Are you kidding me?”

“H-HEY! SHUT UP, MEDEA!” Thana exclaimed, her face redder than a tomato.

“…Oh man. It’s true, then.” Dahlia said, seeing Thana’s reaction.
