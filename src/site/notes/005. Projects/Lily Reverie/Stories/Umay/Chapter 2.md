In a quiet nurse’s office, there was a total of four beds, but only one of them was occupied. The one there was Daryl, the succubus with lime colored hair, who was wearing a tracksuit at the moment. She sat on the bed, staring at the window on one of the adjacent sides of the room. The nurse’s office was otherwise empty, as the nurse went away for a bit. Not only empty, but also very quiet, with the only sounds being the wind and the only movements being those of the curtains as a calm wind blew.

The silence was interrupted by the door opening, door that was on the other adjacent wall. The succubus didn’t move much, only moving her neck to look in direction of the door, trying to see who it was, thought expecting the nurse.

“So the rumor is true!” It was the voice of the girl who talked with Daryl a few days ago, asking for an autograph. Daryl recognized the voice immediately, sighing, and only waited for her to actually enter the room to see the giant rabbit girl’s face once again.

“Aren’tcha gonna come in…?” The girl who sat on the bed said, grumpily.

“Ooh, you want to see me? Recognizing me just by my voice, too!”

“Stop being stupid. Just enter already.”

“Aww.”

The bunny girl finally appeared at the door. Sure enough, she was the same girl as before, the only difference being that she was also wearing a tracksuit this time.

“Can I sit right next to you?” She went inside the nurse’s office, looking a bit at each side while she said that.

“As long as ya don’t do anything weird…” And as soon as she heard that, the bunny immediately sat right next to Daryl. She did that in an impressive speed, which left Daryl a bit surprised. For a second, she was creeped out.

She puffed her cheeks. “Hey! I know the reputation us bunnies have, but I’m not some kind of sexual offender, come on. I’m not a bunny version of that Thana girl, as well! And you aren’t one to talk about that.”

“Okay, okay…” Daryl looked in the violet eyes of the girl who was pouting. “But why are ya even here, Konin?”

“You remembered my name!” She clapped her hands once, feeling happy. “Ooh. I just heard you always end up here when you have PE, and went to check if the rumor was true.”

“Yeah, it is.” Daryl scratched the back of her own neck. “Don’t you have class right now, tho’?”

“Yep! And?”

“Ya ditched just to come here? What excuse did ya even use?”

“Something something about knowing the nurse wouldn’t be here and wanting to be a nurse in the future, so wanting to help.” As she talked, Daryl noticed how Konin’s front teeth were bunny-like.

“Is that even true or just bullcrap?”

“The second option!” Konin smiled, swinging her legs.

“Ya shouldn’t miss class, you know…”

“…Said the notorious delinquent girl.” Konin smirked.

“Uh. Do what I say, don’t do what I do…?” Daryl answered, a bit bashfully. There was no witty comeback she could do. Konin was right.

“Or delinquent wannabe girl, I guess.” She put her index finger to her lips, muttering while closely looking at Daryl.

“Hm?”

“Oh, nothing!~” She closed her eyes and smiled at Daryl.

The was a small silence. Thirty seconds of silence? One minute? It didn’t feel like much, however. Daryl spent that time looking at the window, once again, while Konin looking at her own legs swinging. Then, this time Daryl was the one to end the silence.

“Why are you even that interested in me? You aren’t even attracted to me.” She said. “I mean, at least not romantically or sexually.”

“So the thing about succubi noticing very well the presence or absence of those feelings is true?!” She perked up, her eyes shining.

“Ah, yeah… Don’t tell anyone, tho’.” Daryl said. “Wait, reply what I said!”

“That’s… That’s so cool!” She grabbed Daryl’s hands, excited. “You guys are such an intriguing species, honestly! I’ve always found succubi to be the most interesting species, eheh. There’s just so much amazing stuff I hear, and a lot of them have this mysterious feeling of not knowing if it’s true or not!”

At some point, Konin was shaking Daryl’s hands without noticing. She talked quickly, making little breaks after each word, only stopping then to catch her breath. The succubus was wide-eyed, dumbfounded while staring at the agitated girl. Before Konin would go back to the rant, Daryl quickly snapped out of it and tried to say something and prevent the fangirling.

“So you have an obsession with succubi?”
