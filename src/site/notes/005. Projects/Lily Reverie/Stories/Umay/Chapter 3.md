Closing the door, I did a huge sigh and walked through the empty school halls with my hands inside the tracksuit pants’ pocket. The ambiance was tranquil, the only sounds being my own feet and whenever I passed in front of a classroom, some teacher or another’s lesson. Those moments were, in my view, a special thing I experienced. Weren’t I skipping class, I wouldn’t really get to experience that. And just like so, all the others weren’t experiencing this, and maybe that was exactly what made everything so peaceful. Those were one of the few nice things of my lifestyle, I suppose.

Having reached the staircase, I decided to go up, my destination clear in mind. Sadly, I have to climb three rows of stairs until I reach there. _That’s my own personal PE class, alright._ I sucked it up and started climbing, though. Even if that was despair-inducing for my stamina, it still was better than actual PE, plus I really enjoyed that place and this type of special moment I mentioned are the only times where the rooftop is ever peaceful, as there’s always clubs doing their stuff over there or simply way too much people chatting it up. Even now, I’d probably find someone else that is skipping class. But so far, all of us skippers seem to have a sort of non-explicit, mutual agreement where we just leave each other alone, with greetings usually being the peak of our interactions. Even the more social folk leave the rest of us alone, those always come together with another person or maybe even a group, but only chat between themselves and aren’t too loud. Not that anyone actually approached me in any setting at all, though.

While starting to get out of breath, I finished the staircase and was at the door. I opened it and was finally at the rooftop. I could see a trio a fairies chatting in the distance and not too far off from me a kitsune second-year sat on the ground, messing on her cellphone. She actually looked up to see who it was that arrived and I just lifted my right hand, doing a small wave, to which she nodded as a reply and went back to her phone. We never really talked, but she is here sometimes and at some point we just started greeting each other just because. As for me, I went in the direction of the edge at the north, if you consider the door as the point of reference. The sky was a pretty blue and with just a few clouds in the sky, the sun not too annoying. Getting there, I leaned in the parapet, putting one of my arms over it and the hand of my other arm on my chin. I did a deep breath, still tired from the stairs.

_Ahhh. Fresh air. Peace. I needed this._ Looking over, I could see a small portion of the city and the ocean. I know that one of dormitories most used by students from this school is around there, though I wouldn’t know which building is it. I also know there are some good food places around there. And just like all the places at the coast around here, there are some shops focusing beaches and something or another for marine monster girls that might live here. I’ve seen this scenery a hundred times already at this point, but it still filled me with peace. Especially paying attention to the ocean, seeing the blue water sparkling and sometimes a random animal or a random girl popping up and then going back to the water.

_What to think of all this… This Konin girl, huh?_

_I know she doesn’t mean any harm. In a way, I’m kind of glad she isn’t scared of me nor avoids me; quite the contrary. But still._

_All this bullshit, once again. There’s no way thing could just go… fine, right? Things will always end up like that. Always. Be it a negative thing, be it a positive thing. Even when someone seems to genuinely like me and wants to be friends with me, it’s because of my species all over again… People avoid me because of it and now someone only got interested in me because of it. It’s always like this._

_I mean, I don’t mind the fact she is super interested in succubus and gets very worked up about them. That’s understandable, if I’m going to be honest. There are way too much different rumors about us, so many true, so many false, so many kind of true but not really there. And then there’s stuff that we actually are way worse than one might think, like what’s going on with this city. If people knew… Oh man. But indeed, rumors and stereotypes are pretty relevant when it comes to us, probably more so than any other species. But everything she asked and the way wanted to get closer to me was just about succubus this, succubus that. There was the yuri thing, I guess, but still._

_Maybe I’m asking way too much as I’m complaining about this when this is the first time in high school someone was truly very friendly with me (and didn’t have the hots for me). And I might be anticipating myself way too much, considering this was what, the second time we spoke?_

_But still._

_I just wish she was a bit more interested in Daryl, a person that happens to be a succubus, instead of just in the succubus named Daryl._

_And it doesn’t help that she is super interested precisely in the persona I created. I feel like me opening up would be just letting her down and disappointing her._

_It isn’t all that bad a thing outside that, though. She may have a few screws slightly loose in the head and get too hyper sometimes, but she is a nice person and she doesn’t truly annoy me. How hyped she gets is endearing, in a way. Well, at least when she isn’t getting TOO close to me. Or accidentally hurting my shoulders. I just wonder what the hell she plans on doing regarding the Student Council, as she already mentioned she will try to join us if we manage to win… I need to talk to Scarlett about this later, especially since the elections aren’t even that much farther away._

_Actually, I need to read through some articles and ready up things to advertise our little group, like speeches and posters. Plus contact Scarlett to decide certain things. Geez, I needed this time at the rooftop, but there is too much stuff for me to do. I should stop thinking about whatever happened and do some of the more productive stuff. I can think better about some things here and I can do a bit of my research too, as I’m with my cellphone in one of my tracksuit pants’ pockets._

_I guess Mom offered me the easy way, too, but I’m not going to be corrupt like she wants me to be, pfft. I plan on achieving this with all my hard work._

Thinking all that, I did as I said (well, thought, actually) I’d and started planning for more productive things.
