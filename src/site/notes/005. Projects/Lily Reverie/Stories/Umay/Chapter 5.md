I slowly opened my eyes, feeling refreshed after a long nap. Judging from the illumination, it seemed to still be the afternoon. Things were still as quiet as before I fell asleep, bored from doing nothing all this time. I had no idea, however, what time was it right then, and while still slow from just then waking up, I decided to get up from the soft bed the nurse office had. Only on that moment I realized I wasn't really alone. On the border of the bed where I've previously lied down at, a familiar figure sat, looking at me getting up. My vision was slightly blurry, but... _Judging from the lime-colored hair..._

"So ya were still here during all this time?"

_I've no doubt about it now. It's Daryl. What is she doing here, at this hour...?_

"Huh...?" Still sleepy, I couldn't help but give a half-assed answer.

"I wish ya were sleepy all the time..." She chuckled. "Do ya want some water?"

"Ah, no... I'm okay."

"Alright. Why are ya here, tho'? Can you reply me now...?"

"This is the nurse's office, right?" Daryl nodded looking at me. "Oh. Ah. Remember what I said about the nurse being out for the whole day and that I decided to help out here?"

"Yeah, and didn't ya say this was a bullshit excuse of yours?"

"The wanting to be a nurse part!~" I smiled, feeling my energy returning to me. "I don't necessarily want to be a nurse, but it was true I was going to help out." _Even so, I don't really dislike the idea of becoming a nurse. Learning about the other species' biology and helping others with that knowledge sounds fun! I'm not so sure, though, there's so much things that sound nice.~_

"I see. Ya did that on purpose , didn't ya...?" She raised her eyebrows. _Heehee._

"Maybe? Maybe yes, maybe not?" I touched my lips with my index finger, trying to mess with her. The succubus just sighed, not saying anything. "But what are _you_ doing here, Daryl? Are you feeling unwell?"

"No, I was really searchin' for ya. ...Not because I missed ya or any shit like that, I just need to tell ya something." _That sounded a lot like a tsundere just now. Tsundere delinquent Daryl? Hmm. Interesting and definitely possible!_

"What is it?" I asked, curiously.

"Before that... Ya wanted to get into the student council, right? Do ya even know how you enter it?"

"Huh? Don't I just need to submit an application or something of the sort?"

"No. You really didn't know, huh..." Once again, Daryl sighed. "During elections, a whole team of student council members and their roles are elected at once. And there are four obligatory roles."

"Oh! I see!" _Wait..._ "Ah, is the student council full already?"

"No. I came here to, erm... scout ya. I've discussed it with everyone else, and we wanted to invite ya to be our secretary." She said, closing her eyes, expecting the worse. _Is the sun too bright and hurting her eyes? It's not that bright right now, though..._

"Secretary?"

"It's the only position left. The secretary basically—" I cut her off in the middle of her sentence.

"No, no, I know what the secretary role does. I'm just thinking out loud. Thanks for trying to explain, though!~" I smiled a bit. _Secretary..._

"Oh. Alright." It wasn't very noticeable, but Daryl looked to the side, grumpily, after being cut off. "So, do you accept it or not? We don't really have much time to assemble our team, actually, so..."

"...Of course!" I did a huge smile and without even thinking, just grabbed Daryl's hands. _Honestly, more than anything, I'm so glad she tried to scout me herself! Eheheh~_ "So! You're speaking to Secretary Konin right now!"

"...We ain't even elected yet." Right then, Daryl seemed to move her hands, at my grip, and then stop, doing a defeated face.

"We'll win though, I'm sure!~" I lifted one of my arms, bringing Daryl's along as well, to show enthusiasm. "Oh, right. So how is the full team, then? Scarlett as president, you as vice-president and me as secretary, I know, but you said there are four roles, right? Who is the fourth?"

"Ah, it's Azure. She's in your class, right? She'll be our treasurer." _Ah, so the fourth role is the treasurer! Thinking better about it now, I think being secretary was the best choice for me. I don't like the spotlight being on me as strongly as it is on the president and vice-president, and I don't think I could handle it overall... And I'm terrible with numbers and finances, so treasurer isn't even a possibility._

"Whooa, the girl who ranks on top on almost all exams? Amazing!~" _Well, the treasurer really could only be someone amazing. Azure is too amazing. I think she is usually alone, but... Oh, wait..._

"Yes. Her indeed." _Recently..._

"Isn't she also the girl who is always hanging out with our president?! I mean, future president! Scarlett! They seem super close...!" I ended up releasing Daryl's hands out of excitement, pumping up my fists.

"Yes..." Daryl sighed, putting a hand on her forehead and already imagining what was coming.

"Isn't the Scarlett, like, totally perfect?! Even her flaws like being airheaded seem to be endearing! But... but! Azure is totally different from her, and yet they are so close! So! Close! Can you imagine Scarlett showing her imperfect side to no one but Azure? The mermaid is the only one who truly knows her! And passionate emotions start to bloom, or maybe love is already blooming.~"

"Oh no..." Daryl moved both her hands to her pointy ears, but feeling bad about something, decided not to cover them. Feeling my nose bleed, I wiped the blood. _Hm? Ah, I have to let her give some input about this, too!_

"Don't you think it's totally adorable to see the perfect and popular Scarlett getting so intimate with the nerdy and unpopular Azure?"

"Uh... I dunno... Also, I wouldn't really say they are intimate..."

"Not yet, not yet! But they are slowly getting intimate, I'm sure of it! Slowly, but surely. Ehehe~" I said, and then remembered something. "Don't you know anything from interacting so much with them? They are my OTP, I'm dying for more material!"

"OTP..." Daryl did an awkward laugh. "Ehh, I'm not sure about anything."

"You're a succubus, though! You should know something, anything that I don't. Please, please!" I begged her. At the same time, though, Daryl went quiet, looking down. _Oh. Oh no. Could it be that... Oh my...!_

"Nah, dunno about anythin'." She looked up and scratched her head.

"Daryl... I'm going to ask you something very serious. It might be that you have never had anyone to talk about this before, so I'm sure it might be an immense weight on yourself... But! Know I'm your friend in this! I won't judge, actually, I'll support you!" I grabbed the succubus' hands again, trying to reassure her and transmit a feeling of trust and safe.

"...Eh?" She furrowed her eyebrows, completely confused.

"You... are you in love with Scarlett? Or maybe Azure? Is there a love triangle brewing up in the student council?! You're safe with me, I'm trustworthy! I don't give out spoilers to other people, much less reveal their secrets! I might even try to help you out...! I know a lot about yuri!" I quickly said, Daryl furrowing her eyebrows more and more as I spoke. "Oh! If you are in love with both of them at the same time, I understand that too! Don't worry!"

"What the fuck are you talkin' about, kid?" Daryl said a bit aggressively while definitely trying to remove her hands from mine. This time, I released hers as I noticed that. "I'm not into anyone right now. I've never been into anyone, in fact, so cut off this crap, alright?"

_...I'm sure she is telling the truth. I messed up. And I always forget I'm stronger than the average person, ahah..._

"Ah, sorry. I got too excited, I guess." I apologized. "Then we're somewhat alike regarding that. I've never once been in love with anyone myself. Or into anyone, as you say." I said that calmly, tilting my head slightly and doing a gentle, almost bittersweet expression.

"Really?"

"Yep, really. From how much I like yuri it probably doesn't seem like it, but it's the truth." I giggled. "A lot of people just suppose I'm a lesbian and ask what classmate do I like, but in reality, well... There's just no one, and there's never been."

"Oh, I understand. Well, I believe what you say, especially about not right now, I suppose." She smiled a bit, but warmly for sure. _I don't think I've ever saw her do such an expression with me before. Huh._ "I'm pretty out of touch with rumors and most people at school, so dunno what everyone says about me. Probably shit about succubi, as always, heh."

_I kind of do know part of it. But I don't think she really needs to know... I'm sure she can take it, but those things are unimportant, and she seems to not care. I won't bring it up in this conversation, at least not directly._

"Oh! Does being a succubus affect your own feelings of love?"

"How the hell am I supposed to know that for sure?" Dayrl sighed, her warm expression disappeared. "And I've never been in much contact with other succubi other than sis, either."

"Hm... Is your sister like you in that regard, then?" I asked, curiously.

"I dunno, we don't talk much about ourselves to each other." Daryl rolled her eyes a bit.

"Ah, I see. It's just that if she was like that, maybe it'd be a confirmation about it being species related. Of course, it could just be a coincidence, but...~
