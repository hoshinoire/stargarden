On a school hall, leaning on the wall and messing with her smartphone, was Daryl. Until she was interrupted by a tall girl.

“Excuse me, could you give me an autograph?” The tall girl had bunny ears of the same color as her hair, which was cream colored. Her hair was in an over the shoulder sidetail. The ribbon on her uniform was purple, which meant she was a first year, just like Daryl. She had a notebook and a pen on her hands.

“Eh? Whatcha talking about, kiddo?” She replied, slightly agressively.

“Could you give me an autograph? Please!”

“You bullshittin’ me? I’m not a celebrity, maybe famous at school but that’s it.”  
“Come on, come on. Just write it. Pretty please?” She did a cute, bawling face, getting closer to Daryl.

“If I do, you will leave me in peace, won’t ya?” Daryl sighed.

“Yep!” The bunny smiled and shoved the notebook on Daryl’s face, who then held it, and gave her the pen as well.

The succubus signed her own name on the first blank page she saw.

“Happy now?”

“Yes! But… Could you write my own name? I’m Konin. It’s spelled like–”

“I know how it’s spelled.” She then wrote Konin’s name there. “There. But why the hell did you want an autograph? Are ya a fangirl or some shit like that?”

“Not really.” She chuckled.  “Well, I can tell you, but I’d want to be a bit more than just acquaitances before that, ehehe.”

“Oh shit. You hittin’ on me?” Daryl perked up instantly.

“Aaah, no, not really!” She scratched her head, laughing and blushing a bit. “I’m just asking if you want to be friends. I’d really like to be, at least.”

“Nah.”

“I won’t let you in peace until you say yes, though!” She clenched her fists, pumped up. Probably even more pumped up than before.

“Whatever you say… Tch… Good luck getting me to say yes.”

“You’re trying to get into the Student Council, right? Well, even if you keep saying no for now, we’ll eventually become very good friends there, I’m sure?”

“We… We what?” Daryl said, confused and slightly creeped, furrowing her eyebrows.

“I mean that I’m going to join the Student Coucil too, ehehe.” She took the notebook and pen from Daryl’s hands.

“What? Why even?”

“Aw, c’mon. I like that kind of stuff. And it’s a very nice bonus that I’d get to know you better!”

“I don’t even know if I’m really going to be elected, tho. And eh… The rumors are true, you’re kinda weird.”

“I know, I know. I’m a weirdo. But you aren’t exactly very normal as well, Daryl.” She chuckled seeing Daryl puff her cheeks hearing that. “I’m sure you will, though. You’re Scarlett’s vice-president, right? Everyone’s already sure she will–”

The bell rang.

“Aww. Already?” Konin said as soon as the bell stopped ringing.

“Finally…” Daryl  sighed, and started heading north.

“See ya!” She smiled, hugging her notebook and heading south.
