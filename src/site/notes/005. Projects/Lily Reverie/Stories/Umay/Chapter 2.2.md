“Hmm, perhaps you could say that.” She replied quickly. “I’m very interested in other species in general, but yes, succubi are probably my favorite ones. On, and you also remind me of some characters I really like in fiction, so that’s also a plus.”

“…Huh?” Daryl was ready to say something snarky, but the last part caught her off-guard. Konin chuckled at her confusion, and didn’t say anything. “Uh… So ya a nerd that’s specially obsessed with succubi?”

“Indeed! Now you got it completely right.”

A small silence.

“Ya… Ya really aren’t gonna explain to me what did you mean by remindin’ you of fiction?”

“Sure. You really remind me of those delinquent archetypes, and they’re pretty cool. Also, the popular, kind of seductive girl. And I’ve never seen a mesh up of those two, so it’s very interesting and so great! Also, you actually having your own fangirls makes me feel like I’m actually inside the world of some things I love to read.~” She swooned a bit over there, closing her eyes and doing a pleased expression. She most probably wasn’t even aware of what exactly she was saying anymore, her thoughts heading to a daydream.

The succubus wasn’t really surprised with anything Konin was saying, anything except maybe the last bit, and even then, she wasn’t VERY surprised. She was actually nodding to most of what the bunny girl was saying, getting it completely. “Ohhh, that stuff. I see…” She said. “Ya into lesbian fiction n’ shit, right? Likes comics or whatever. Well, I guess I get the full picture now. A nerd obsessed with succubi that is into yu–, I mean, lesbian stuff. And likes delinquent and popular girls as well. No wonder ya got interested in me, then.”

She kept swooning until she heard a very interesting part in what Daryl was saying. Ironically, this very interesting part was precisely the thing Daryl corrected herself midway. Hearing it, she stopped, blinked and stared at the other girl for a few seconds, who had look on her face that basically said ‘what?’. Then, she quickly got very close to Daryl’s face and almost accidentally pushed her down on the bed. “Are you a connoisseur as well?!”

“Dude, calm down. I said ya could sit next to me as long as ya didn’t try doing weird shit.” She tried to get a bit away from her, but Konin immediately closed the distance and then put her hands on each side of Daryl’s shoulders, holding her.

“Are you?!” The succubus was slowly panicking, slightly scared with the girl.

“I-I don’t even know whatcha talkin’ about…” She tried getting away, but she couldn’t. The bunny girl’s grip was surprisingly strong and if Daryl forced herself too much to try to get away, it could actually hurt. And she wouldn’t get away, anyway. “Y-ya sure are a big girl…” She muttered to herself.

“I mean, you almost said ‘yuri’! Most people don’t know the word! Are you into it?! A fellow connoisseur?!” She shook the other girl’s shoulders without noticing.

“Ah… Ya noticed, eh…” She sighed. “Not really. Just read a bit of it for research purposes…” The girl plummeted down after hearing that, loosening her grip. Daryl took the chance to immediately get away from being too close to the bunny girl. After a few seconds, though, Konin got excited again. Not to the extent she was before, but still quite excited.

“For research purposes like actual research purposes or _for ‘research’ purposes_?” She wished the answer would be the latter, but her hopes weren’t honestly that high.

“Actual research purposes. I’m not like ya.” She rolled her eyes at actually being asked that while massaging her own shoulders. Konin’s grip actually hurt a bit. “I actually don’t even like the romance genre much.”

“Oh, I see…” She did a slightly sad face, but perked up once again. “Still, you’re still a bit of a connoisseur! Way more than most people and maybe actually everyone I’ve met!”

The girl was getting close to Daryl again. Seeing that, Daryl immediately got up from the bed. She couldn’t think about what Konin said; she just wanted to get away. “Please. Let’s not do this again.”

“What are you talking about?”

“Ya gettin’… Too intense. Too close. That shit.”

“Uhm… I don’t get it.”

“Did ya seriously not notice…?”

“No?”

Daryl facepalmed while Konin watched, confused. “Anyway, I guess I do know more than the average person, but whatever. When is the damn nurse comin’ back, though?”

“Ah, I didn’t tell you? She is taking the day off.”

“…For real?”

“Yep.”

“Guess I’m going for a walk around school for a while, then.” She said, going in the direction of the door.

“Wait, why don’t you stay and so we chat? You supposedly shouldn’t be feeling that well, too! And we could become friends, and you could tell me stuff about your species, and I could tell you about mine and where I’m from, too! So–“

“Nah, that was enough interaction for today. Goodbye.” Daryl went through the door and closed it.

“Aw.” Konin thought about going after Daryl, but she knew it was useless and would just make her mad. She then smiled a bit to herself, pleased. “For today, huh? So she recognizes there will be a next time, teehee.”
