"Oi, what did you do to Tsubaki?"
"Hmmmm?"
"Don't play dumb, Shizue. We've known each other for way too much time already, I know you better than I wish I did."
"Hmhm, for sure. But whatever do you mean regarding... Tsubaki-chan?~"
"Tsubaki-chan..." Eryn sighed. That devilish intonation. That honorific. This was Shizue's way of simultaneously playing dumb and confirming that it was indeed, what the redhead thought. "So she's your new plaything, huh?"
"Don't you think she's really cute?"
"...I thought you'd go for Damaia instead. Well, I DID consider you going after Tsubaki, or even Beatrice, but still."
"Damaia, eh?" She takes a sip of tea and breathes peacefully. "She's a bit *too* easy to mess with. She's really rough and bratty, but she's very honest. What you see is what you get when it comes to her, don't you think? And despite her temper, she actually seems to have it all together."
"Well... If you put it that way, yes, she's an open book. And eceryone teases her, but she's kind of mature."
"Yes, yes. I agree with you. Likewise, Beatrice seems somewhat mature and stable. I'm sure she isn't an open book however, and it makes me curious about what is hiding under all that composure, just like I still have an itch to break it but..."
"Yeah. Too much work to break someone that seems healthy?" Shizue let out an audible chuckle.
"Eryn-chan, my dear, don't you already know the lengths I'm willing to go?"
"Of course. Just making sure you're as much of a sociopath with a terrifying willpower as you've always been."
"You say that, but aren't you following my thought process perfectly? Doesn't this bode interesting things regarding yourself?"
"Hang out with a sicko, the sickness starts rubbing on you." The two chuckled at the playful banter. "So why not Beatrice?"
"To put it bluntly, I doubt whatever she's hiding is that fragile or painful for her, especially if somehow any of my guesses are right... She's also pretty modest and nice to everyone, it doesn't feel that satisfying to break someone like that. Maybe not fair too, but not like I care about that."
"Right, you definitely don't. What's your guess about her then? I'm curious."
"Don't you think that little prude act of hers is kind of forced? Haven't you noticed any weird reactions of hers in general, especially when it comes to sexual things, and not in a prude way exactly? Or her ambiguity regarding her tentacles? I don't know her well and she isn't an open book for me to make any other and actually important guesses, but still, my guess is that she's a degenerate. Alraunee-san already confirmed she's into women, anyway." She takes another sip.
"Now that you mention it... Yeah, I can actually see that being the case."
"Right? She screams prude but actually degenerate to me." She says and her smile turns a little more mischievous. "I'm sure this guess of mine is way more interesting for you than for me, isn't it? Since she seems to have caught Eryn-chan's attention, after all."
"? I just want to know what kind of person is in my team." Eryn groans, preparing for what might come.
"Sure, sure. I'll pretend I believe you and let you off this time. Then again maybe you don't even realize it, huh?" The other elf lets out a sigh as a reply. "Regardless, making a prude admit how much of a degenerate she is might be interesting for sure, but it's personally not so much my thing. Now, Tsubaki..."
"She pushes all your buttons, huh?"
"That she does. The things I'd do to her... I don't know how you didn't guess she'd be my prey after all."
"Eh. You already started your offensive with her, haven't you? The way she acts around you got more odd. And I notice you sending her some of your devious glares and smiles from time to time, which always elicits some reaction on her."
"As expected of my dear Eryn-chan. Perceptive as always. But yes, I even voiced my lovely intentions to her~"
"Sigh... I'd say don't break that girl too much, but that's literally your goal, huh?"
"Exactly!" She clapped her hands.
"And you know what makes Tsubaki-chan even better? I'm sure she's a virgin!"
"...and Damaia and Beatrice aren't, then?"
"I doubt Damaia is. Beatrice is probably one, but she'd be honest about her virginity or even wear it as some badge of honor. Tsubaki? Can you imagine that girl admitting it? Or not being defensive regarding it?"
"Well... No."
"See?!"

"You know fully well who was the only person I truly fell in love with, Eryn-chan, and you know that's been over with way too much time ago. And to be honest, I don't really intend to experience that again." She sighed.

"I hope we can stay friends during our entire long lives."
"Yeah."
