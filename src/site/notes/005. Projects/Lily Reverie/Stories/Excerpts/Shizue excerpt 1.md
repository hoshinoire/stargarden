"You know, I think the people who hate you really misjudge."
A carefree yet cold tone. Creepy, chilly to the core.
Just like usual.
"What do you want?"
Seemingly as if nothing was said at all, Shizue kept talking.
"Rather than detestable, your behavior is very, very cute to me."
"Ha?"
She fixated her eyes on Tsubaki. Cold glare.
Just like usual.
And she got closer to her, carrying her chilly aura.
"Girls like you are really cute, Tsubaki-chan. Putting up such a strong and bitchy front... but utterly weak and seeking to protect themselves."
Tsubaki flinched, Shizue kept getting closer to her.
"What is it you're hiding, Tsubaki-chan? What are you afraid of? Do you want to make everyone avoid you and hate you because you're afraid of letting someone too close and they backstabbing you?"
"..."
She was finally face to face to Tsubaki. A piercing, almost emotionless glare coupled with a smile.
"Did you just see someone who acts like this and tried to mimic that? Do you hate yourself so much you want everyone to hate you as well? Or do you hate who you normally are, and this is somehow your idealization and you're living the dream since nobody knows how you used to be?"
"...this is my true self." Tsubaki mumbled.
Shizue chuckled and placed one of her cold hands on Tsubaki's face, touching it delicately. Her expression was that of someone very pleased.
"Oh dear, it's no use saying that to me. I'm sure some of it is true, no one is a perfect actress, but I can see right through your fa√ßade. I've seen too many people like you before, all of them very cute. But you're the cutest of them all, Tsubaki-chan."
Silence.
She kept stroking Tsubaki's face and her other hand started stroking her hair.
"People like you just give me a very interesting urge, actually. Like I said, you people are so cute... And you people are at your cutest when I probe your little heads until something breaks there and you admit just how weak, how insecure, how pitiable, how utterly pathetic you feel deep inside. When all your vulnerability exposes itself, compared to how strong you try to act normally... It's really delightful."
"You're sick." Tsubaki shoved Shizue's hand out of her face and got away from her. Shizue didn't insist and just chuckled, her face extremely pleased with the outcome.
"Oh, I am. But Tsubaki-chan, I really can't wait, and I hope it'll be by my own hand... Like I said, you're the cutest of all of them, so my expectations are very high. When I break you, just how cute will you be at your cutest?~"
"Go fuck yourself." Tsubaki said angrily and left the base in a haste. She still had a bit of her composure for sure, but was visibly altered.
"Hehe. You didn't even deny anything I said... I really can't wait, Tsubaki-chan."
