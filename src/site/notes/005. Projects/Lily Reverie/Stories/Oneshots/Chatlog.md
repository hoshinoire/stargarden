Ori: Hey, Mae

Mae: ?

Ori: Ever heard of that VR MMO game that they say uses shapeshifter slaves to simulate the world?

Ori: Just stumbled with that and found it interesting

Ori: Though, it's probably some bullshit in the end

Mae: oh yeah, that

Mae: yeah I have, it's a rumor that floats around for some time

Mae: esp in my former village

Mae: they used to mention it as a way to make kitsunes and other shapeshifters calm their asses down

Ori: Calm down from doing what, exactly?

Mae: you know we have the trickster stereotype going on right

Mae: and that our culture encourages that even and it's true for most normalfags

Mae: (like my sis)

Ori: Yeah

Ori: So? Seems weird for them to encourage that kind of behavior, but also spread rumors to make you people calm down lol

Mae: hmm

Mae: the thing is

Mae: a good amount of them go *too* far

Mae: this enslaving shapeshifters thing? they say the mimis that do it

Mae: and well, according to the rumors the MMO is from their continent indeed

Mae: so some shapeshifters supposedly go there just to mess around

Ori: ...why would you people go THAT far just for shit and giggles?

Ori: There's enough people and cultures to mess with already around here

Mae: idk m8

Mae: don't ask me, the ones who do that shit are the normies

Mae: I'm content with just light trolling, no more than that

Ori: "Light"

Ori: But... Hm...

Ori: Is there even any proof about all this being true? Especially since it circulates in your village for a long time already, so you'd think there'd be something concrete about it already

Mae: nah

Mae: just random testimonies from some who claim to have escaped from it

Mae: but everyone is kinda mistrustful of each other by default because kitsunes and shapeshifters in general are little shits

Mae: plus tbh rumors about shapeshifter species getting caught and then being killed or whatever is the oldest shit ever

Mae: this mmo thing is just another version of this shit for modern times, in a way

Mae: so w/e

Mae: oh yeah, and there's also random disappearances that people claim to be because of that

Mae: but nobody gives a fuck really

Mae: people go away to play around with shapeshifting all the time, meh

Ori: So the chances of it just being some kind of urban legend and bullshit is pretty high.

Mae: indeed

Mae: I don't take it seriously too much myself, but it's interesting to think about it

Mae: it's an interesting concept

Mae: plus it's pretty interesting that magitech might be at that point there

Mae: somehow managing to make a VR game AND integrating it with something like putting your conscience in the body of a shapeshifter?

Mae: actually just picking out a shapeshifter for that is pretty genius

Mae: makes sense that they could be true avatar makers in a way

Mae: actually it's probably not even an actual game...? idk, might be a real setting or some stuff

Mae: okay ramble got too long

Ori: Heh.

Ori: The ramble was good, it's alright

Ori: Yeah, it really is an interesting concept

Ori: Just wish there was more proof or something, as it stands it's probably bullshit

Mae: I guess

Mae: idc much tho, if it's fun to think about it doesn't make much of a difference lol

Mae: if it's real probably sucks for the enslaved however

Ori: Not gonna lie

Ori: They REALLY shouldn't have went that far

Ori: It's downright stupid.

Ori: Not saying they deserve it per se, but it's really, REALLY stupid

Mae: tbh I agree

Mae: oh yeah something else that I find interesting about it

Ori: What?

Mae: like

Mae: the players probably don't even have any idea they're controlling really an enslaved shapeshifter

Mae: at least I can't imagine something like this being considered ok to happen?

Mae: or maybe mimis really don't give a fuck

Ori: Nah, from what I've read they're more serious about laws and human rights and stuff than us

Ori: Well, at least that's what I remember from my classes about it and the books I read

Ori: If the rumor is true, yeah, players probably don't know what is really going on

Mae: eh, never paid too much attention to humanities

Ori: Do you pay too much attention to ANY of your classes...?

Mae: no

Mae: I mean I pay attention to some stuff but

Mae: not too much like you said

Mae: but you're in a whole different level anyway, ms. top grades

Ori: I'm just smart AND responsible bro

Ori: You're a slacker, if you tried hard you could have top grades in your class too

Ori: You're smart after all, pretty sure you could do it.

Mae: waaaa, keep complimenting me like this and I'll fall for you ~~ >_<

Ori: Okay, forget I said anything. Actually. I might've called you dumb...

Mae: noooooo, you were supposed to keep seducing me :( :( :(

Ori: Lmao

Mae: kek

Ori: But honestly, you're right, it might be bullshit but it really is... pretty interesting

Mae: it was the players not knowing about it part that piqued your interest wasn't it

Ori: How the fuck did you know?

Mae: you got more excited after that part lol

Mae: and I know you for a long time already c'mon

Mae: I already know that you enjoy this kind of... kinda unsettling/creepy stuff?

Mae: you're edgy asf after all

Ori: Hey

Mae: what? have any rebuttal?

Mae: ms. "I dislike calling my species killer whale because we AREN'T whales but actually the killer part is pretty cool"

Ori: Shut up.

Mae: oh yeah something else that probably interests you about it

Mae: if they're really enslaved shapeshifters the ERP experience should be pretty crazy, don't you think?

Mae: you're the specialist about those things

Ori: Shut up, I haven't done that stuff in a goddamn long time

Mae: whatever helps you sleep at night bro

Ori: I admit it, though.

Mae: what?

Ori: That... kind of interests me, really

Mae: ORI HACKING INTO THE ENSLAVING VR MMO JUST FOR ERPING LET'S GOOOOOOOOO

Ori: I think there might be a girl at my school that plays some MMO from the mimis

Ori: Maybe it's not this one, but...

Ori: Hmmm...

Mae: oh holy fuck are you really going to do it

Mae: please stop making the coomer memes about you real

Ori: You know I've long admitted to being a coomer already

Ori: I have no shame about this anymore.

Mae: dude

Mae: I mean I know that but dude you sure are a degenerate ffs

Mae: what's coming now bro

Mae: are you gonna ask the girl to make her in-game model look like the lamia you're into

Mae: and then fuck?

Ori: Oh for fuck's sakeÂ Mae, shut the fuck up, I'm leaving.

Mae: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Mae: got you flustered bro

Ori: Fuck you, Mae

Mae: thanks for the reaction

Mae: glad to see you not considering it seriously tho

Ori: >implying I'm not considering it

Mae: ...

Mae: bro

Mae: you know what I'm the one leaving

Mae: fucking coombrain

Ori: Yeah, yeah

Ori: Hope your sister never gets enslaved bro

Mae: holy shit kek

Mae: she really seems like the type of asshat who would go that far and fuck up so hard

Ori: I said that as a joke but

Ori: That's... true, she really seems like it

Ori: Your sister is a fucking little shit

Mae: sure is

Mae: anyway I was kinda joking but I'm really gonna leave for a bit lol

Mae: going to play a game

Ori: Okay

Ori: See you

Mae: see ya
