"Excuse me, Ciara. Could I have a quick talk with you?"

"Yes, what is it?"

"I'll be blunt. Do you still have the mana ashes of your..." _She never explicitly called their relationship romantic, did she?_ "...your fallen, war partner?"

"...What exactly is your aim in asking me that?" She furrowed her eyebrows, seeming to have gotten a bit nervous after my last phrase.

"I mean no harm. No, no. I mean the exact opposite of that."

"What. Do. You. Want?"

"Hmm. Perhaps you'd call me crazy for that, just like so many people do, but in my pursuit of science, knowledge... I've finally obtained my new aim." I clear my throat. "I want to bring a dead person back to life."

"So you want to use Roisin's mana ashes as your guinea pig to experiment with. The answer is no."

"No, no. I don't want to use her to test it. My _final objective_ is bringing Roisin back to life. Alas, I've only envisioned my new pursuit so far, so I'm not even going to ask for her ashes anytime soon. I'll only do that when I'm sure about what I'm doing."

Ciara seemed a bit confused. There seems to be... a lot of emotions swelling up in her?

"Why...?"

"We've known each other for a while, haven't we? I want the knowledge. You want your most important person back. And for sure, doing something like this for someone you know feels more meaningful than doing for a random person." _There's also the fact it's more probable you'd accept._

"This... this is delusional, though. No such thing is possible. The rumors about you being insane are true, Minerva." She sighs.

"Oh, you innocent child. If only you knew of my true deeds. Perhaps someday I can tell you about them, then you'd rather call me a mad scientist, which I admit is fairly accurate."

"What are you talking about...?"

"Perhaps I can explain better later. Just be aware I've managed to make the impossible happen already, even though everyone always called it delusion. It might have led to being called a monster, but truly, I've done it. And it's no delusion of mine, it's real."

"Is this supposed to convince me or something? You're honestly only creeping me out."

"If it creeps you or not, it's your own issue. I'm just attesting to my competency and to my claim that so-called delusions aren't always impossible."

"..."

"You don't need to agree or accept right now. You have all the time in the world to think about it, just tell me if you decide anything, Ciara."

"Right..." She scratched her face and looked at the clock. "It's almost time for class, I'm heading out..."

_Ahhhh. Why haven't I thought about this earlier?_ _Why did I take so much time to realize that this shall, indeed, be my new goal?_

_After managing to create life in a way so-called impossible, unnatural, against biological laws... Bringing back someone to life! Ah, yes! C'est magnifique!_

_Perhaps this is a way to atone for my "sins". After claiming so many lives with my original experiment, the same monster will bring someone back to life._

_But I don't care about that, just about Celena forgiving me._

_The idea, however, of bringing a dead person back to life, and not as a zombie or a ghost, is simply fascinating._

_Ah, to test the limits of reality! The limits of science! The limits of magitech! I want to reach them all, I've already surpassed one of them. I want to understand and break them all._

_So much, so much that no other scientist will ever be able to have managed the feats that I managed to do._

_Ha. HAHAHAHA!_ _Finally, a new goal after 20 years of stagnation!_

_This shall mark the beginning of my new pursuit,_

_DAY XX, YEAR XXXX_
