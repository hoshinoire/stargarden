Carrying a stack of document papers, my lower body slithered through the corridor while my mind was elsewhere. *That chapter that released yesterday was really good, wasn't it? I think we're getting to a confession, maybe next chapter? I mean, the author has been building this up for a while, and Aki finally seems rea--*
"Lettie!"
*Ah... Here we go again...*
I hold myself back from letting out a sigh and already prepare my facial expression with a flowery smile as I turn my head in the direction of the source of that annoying, high pitched sound uttering that stupid cutesy nickname. ...Yet it is befitting of the way I act, isn't it?
"Hello!~"
The girl calling my name had a long blonde hair, black at tips and she wore a purple flower hairclip. Her ears were round and with some black dots. A pretty face. *Oh, the cheetah, girl right? What was her name again?* As I was thinking, the girl walked in my direction, laughing and smiling. *Ahh, her vivid purple eyes. Of course. Her name is Violet, if I'm not mistaken.*
"What are you doing, Lettie? I didn't see you much these days."
*And if I'm not mistaken, she's as dumb as a brick. Pretty stupid, really.*
"Oh, yeah, this week has been crazy busy, you wouldn't believe it. You know how club activities are starting soon right? There's lots of paperwork to look through and organize..."
*I wonder what she wants. Does she have a question? Or does is it a favor? Or just banal chitchat?*
"Ah! True, I forgot about that! Clubs, huh? You guys must be tired with all this workload..."
*Knowing normies like this, it's probably just useless chatting.*
I drop down my shoulders as Violet finished her phrase and let out a huge sigh as a way to show my sheer exhaustion.
"Oh, we all are! I'm so, so tired... I can't wait until this gets done with, aahh... I hope next week is calmer..."
*Well, it's true the other Student Council girls are tired, they're doing all the work, after all. I just have these small errands though, so I'm actually fine. Heh.*
"I can tell! Girl, if next week is calmer, you should rest and have some fun! You deserve it!"
*Oh no. I can see where this is going. Oh no no no no. Shut up, stupid riajuu. My idea of relaxing and having fun is very far from any of you...*
"I know, right?! I really have no idea if it's gonna be busy or not, but fingers crossed it goes alright! I just want to sleep all day..."
I lift my shoulders back up again, as if cheered up, and clap my hands together.
"Yeah, I'll be cheering for you! If you're free next week, me and my friends are going to karaoke. You should totes come together with us!"
*Jackpot.
If I shoot up an excuse now or say that I remembered something I have to do it'll just sound like a lie. Hmmm. Good thing the Student Council is pretty convenient.*
"Ohhh, that sounds like fun! I'd love it! Are you sure your friends wouldn't mind?"
*If it was the reverse, Azure would totally mind. Actually, she would mind just going to the karaoke to begin with. I should suggest something like that to her sometime, her reaction should be funny.*
"Nah, I'm sure not! Eleanor even looks up to you, eheh~"
*Pffft. Little does she know that the 'Lettie' she looks up to so much doesn't really exist. Though, this still IS satisfying to hear.*
"Really? Eleanor does? This makes me happy! I'm glad~"
*Who the fuck even is Eleanor, though. Well, who cares? I know I don't.*
Violet nods rapidly.
"She does, she does! Though she'd be embarrassed knowing I told you that, heheh."
*It really is just dumb chitchat... What a waste of time... I wish I was talking with Azure right now instead of with this boring bitch.*
"Awww, that's cute. I can keep that a secret if you want me to! It'll be hard to not tease her, though."
I chuckled.
"Please do! Thank you! When she nags at me it's hell!"
*Seeing how you behave, I'm sure it's for good reason...*
"Will do!~"
*Can I go back to delivering the paperwork now...? C'mon.*
"Oh, oh! Lettie, did you see the news?"
*Of course not. Can't you just shut up? I'm carrying a bunch of papers here.*
"Hm? What news?"
"About Claire! You saw, right? Everyone's talking about it!"
*Who.*
"Claire...?"
"C'mon Lettie, the actress from the newest NCU movie! You loved her movie, remember?"
*Ah, yes. NCU. Normie Cinematic Universe. So it's celebrity bullshit. Now this is even MORE boring than the previous topic.*
"Ah! Right! Yeah, that was my favorite NCU movie. Sorry, I'm so tired I forgot for a second."
*To be honest, I just skimmed over a summary about the movie and lied that I watched it. I can't care about that cape bullshit at all. I wish you'd insert a whole cape inside your whore mouth since you like it so much and shut up.*
"It's okay, I understand! Anyway, it just made the news she's now dating! Her partner is really cute too, almost as much as her~"
*Oh for fuck's sake.*
She picks up her phone and types quickly. *Gonna show me a photo of them, huh...*
"Really? Oh man, how didn't I hear about that? This is incredible news!"
*...not. Lmao.*
Violet nods silently, still messing with her phone, and then shows me a photo of Claire with some random boy, though he seemed kind of feminine.
"There they are! Such a pretty couple they make!~"
*I. Don't. Really. Care. Not only it's celebrity stuff, it's also hetshit. Great. Oh, wait, this is my chance.*
I look up at the time on her phone. It's not like I was scheduled to deliver this at any specific time, but...
"They really do! They look great together. Oh, by the wa--"
Excited, Violet talks over me.
"Very! Very great! You know, I was really surprised about the news, I didn't expect to hear that Claire not only is dating, she actually has a gi--"
I cut her off.
"Ah! Look at the time! I'm late, I was supposed to have delivered this already!"
I try to sound as if panicking.
"Ohh, oops. See you then, Lettie! Good luck with the work!"
*About damn time.*
"Thank you~"
My lower body finally starts slithering again through the corridor. That is, until I hear Violet's voice and her rushing footsteps one more time.
*Not again...*
"Lettie, I forgot to ask you something! I was looking for you to ask that, actually!"
*You... Actually had something to say other than all that boring talk...? For fuck's sake...*
"What is it? Just make it quick, I don't want the teacher to get mad at me, ahah."
"I will! Just to make sure, that socialization club starts soon, right?"
"Hm? Yes, yes! By next week it should start already, if everything goes right."
*Does she want to join? No way I'm putting her in the division I'm in charge of. What an annoying normie.*
"I heard Dahlia will be in that club, is that true?"
*Dahlia? Since when are these two friends? Wait, didn't Dahlia 'bully' her once?*
"Well... Maybe I shouldn't tell people this, but I'll make an exception for you, Violet, since you're such a nice girl! Yes, she will."
*It's perfectly fine to tell her that, actually.*
"Ohh, that's good to know! Thank you Lettie, sorry for bothering you!"
She smiled and genuinely thanked me.
*Now, I can't help but be slightly curious... Just slightly.*
"It's fine! Are you planning on joining?"
"Oh, not really. I already have a club, after all. I just want to visit the club from time to time, eheh. Well, now see you for real, Lettie! Bye bye!~"
She blushed slightly as she said that.
*Is she...? Huh.*
"I see. Well, that's sure to be fun! And yeah, bye bye~"
My lower body gets to work again, this time without any interruptions.
*It's finally over. Holy shit. I thought she wouldn't ever shut up.
Why am I so nice to that girl again? Usual reputation management or was there something else?
Oh, wait. I remember why now.
I know who Eleanor is after all. The class rep.
It's certainly great to know I'm in her good's graces. Guess I'm doing everything right. Or appearing to. Doesn't matter.
Now to deliver these papers... This was the longest fucking corridor trip I've ever done. I wonder if Azure and the other girls are already done delivering their share?*
