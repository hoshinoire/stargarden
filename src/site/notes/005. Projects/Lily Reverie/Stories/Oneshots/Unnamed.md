"Hey, Scar."

I said as she pushed my wheelchair in the empty hallway. This question has always been in my mind, and as I got to know Scar better, not just Lettie, that question's presence grew even more. Of course, I had a theory that could answer it, but still.

"What is it?"

"Why are you so nice to me?"

"Eh? You're literally my best friend, dummy."

"No, let me word that better. I mean at the start, way before we actually got close and I didn't even know the real you. Do you remember the first day we talked?"

"Of course. Those damn normalfags were badmouthing you right in front of you, tried to talk with me and I introduced myself to you."

"Yes. Why did you do that? Not only you're never the one to strike conversations. Besides, it could've hurt your reputation with someone that's... Well... Like me."

A short silence, followed by an almost inaudible, dry chuckle.

"Yeah. I knew it could've. Why indeed..."

"You don't know why? Well, makes sense. It's you after all."

"Hey." She jokingly complained. Though she IS the densest person I know, but at least she is aware she's stupid. "I guess in a way I do know, but it's... Hard to put into words."

"Huh. Well, if you ever manage to come up with words for that, do tell."

"Sure. There's a little bit I can say already, though."

"Which would be?"

Scar clears her throat. Ah, she's probably embarrassed. She always does that when she is. ...Cute.

"You... reminded me a little bit of the old me, plus the masked part of myself. And I didn't want you to become like I did, nor to go through any similar suffering." She cleared her throat again. I stayed in silence, knowing she was still going to say something.

Still, at this moment, it's like I could finally confirm if the way I solved that jigsaw puzzle was correct, if the way I carefully placed all these pieces during a long time did, in fact, reflect reality. Each little piece of one out of countless jigsaw puzzles this girl is.

"I guess in a way by helping you it'd be like helping the old me...?" She did a little sigh, probably thinking it sounds silly.

"Well, I guess that's more or less what I expected."

"Really?"

"I already know you way too well, Scar."

"Probably better than I myself do, huh?"

"Oh, I'm sure of that."

"Shut up."

There was a bit of an awkward but at the same time warm silence after that, broken by just a nearly inaudible mutter.

"In the end it was one of the best things I ever did, not for the past me, but the present me."

"Hm? Did you say something, Scar?"

In actuality I understood what she said, but it was something not for any ears to hear other than her own. It was almost as if I was eavesdropping on her inner monologue.

"No, I was just humming a song."

"Oh, okay."

I never knew hearing a hummed song could sound so good.
