"Hey~" (Byakko) "You both like girls, right?~ So... what do you think of the popular girls at school?~" sleepy sleepy

"I don't discuss such matters. Hmph." (Eleanor)

"Waaa, so it's something like last time agaaain?~" (Byakko)

"No. Shut up." (Eleanor)

"I'm not against a talk like that myself! What girls are you talking about, Byakko?" (Violet)

"Aaahhh~" (Byakko) "I guess... Aya, Daryl... Thana... Juniper seems rather popular, too~"

"I sometimes forget Thana used to be so popular..." (Violet)

"Right?~ This year she just changed so much and really fell down~" (Byakko) "But is she your type?~"

"Hmm, not really." (Violet) "Honestly, I always found her flirting kind of exaggerated... and she is just... uhm, how do I say it..." shy (Violet)

"Like a slut?~"

"Y-yeah, I feel kind of bad saying that, though. I feel like she would just have sex with you and absolutely no romance... I don't want such a thing! I want love. Also, bats are kind of ugly." (Violet)

"I get you, I get you~" (Byakko) nodded

"Of course you'd be an idealistic regarding love..." (Eleanor)

"Eleanooor, you're so cynical~" (Byakko) "Can't you confirm things about Thana, though?~ You two had a fling, riight?~"

"That's my own private matters and no one else needs to know." (Eleanor) blushed and turned away

"Aww, stop being so serious~" (Byakko) "You should be more like Violet~"

"Just shut up." (Eleanor)

"Waa~" (Byakko) "Well, what about Aya? Though I can already picture your answer~"

"Too masculine." (Violet) replied quickly

"Aww~" (Byakko) "If I liked girls I'd be into her, I find her kinda cute. Actually, if only she were a boy...~"

"Yeah, yeah, but all her prettiness goes away the second she opens her mouth. She is way too dumb and way too crazy." (Eleanor)

"That's true, too. Even if she's not my type to being with, her mouth really does kind of ruin her altogether." (Violet)

"Right?" (Eleanor)

"Dunno~ She is fun to listen to~"

"Yeah, too bad she isn't a boy, you two really would do a supreme pair." (Eleanor) said, (Violet) chuckled

"What do you mean?~"

"Nothing. Who is the next girl you're going to ask about?"

"I thought you weren't gonna participate in the conversation.~"

"I'm not. Anyway, go back to it."

"Huh.~"

"T-the next one was Daryl, I think?" Â (Violet)

"Oh, yes~" (Byakko) "What do you girls think of her?~"

"W-well... I'm a bit biased because she looks like Dahlia..." (Violet) blushed a bit. "Plus, Dahlia told us about how succubi works, so I kind of get Daryl a bit more. I wouldn't say she's my type, though."

"Ohh, yeah~" (Byakko) "I get you~"

"Yeah, I guess she is alright."

"So she has Eleanor's approval? Oh my~"

"Yeah, yeah, something like that." (Eleanor)

"Ohhh~"

"Anyway, next one... Juniper, right?" (Eleanor)

"I wish she was my mom~"

"Okay... Violet? What about you?"

"I-I actually find her really cute and nice. I kind of like her a bit, eheh." (Violet) blushed. "If it wasn't for Dahlia, I'd probably have fallen for her."

"Hmm. I find her too clingy myself. And her breasts are too big."

"That's... just a preference you have that I don't really share..." (Violet) "But yeah, Junie is so kind! And she is such a big sister to everyone, plus she is beautiful. And she manages to be so smooth sometimes!"

"She is kind of clumsy a lot of the times, though. Do you still find her smooth despite those?"

"Sure! I find those moments pretty cute myself, it's endearing."

"I like those moments too, I find them funny~" (Byakko)

"I do agree with you, a bit." (Eleanor)

"Yay, Eleanor agreed with me for once~" (Byakko) "But Junie has been getting more and more popular lately, right?~"

"I think so. There was always some people who liked her, but that some people started increasing a lot. She's probably way more popular than Thana now, right?

"For sure~" (Byakko)

"Maybe it's because of Thana herself. Her popularity has been falling, right? And so Juniper's raises."

"Ohh, good point." (Violet) "I thought maybe more people were getting to know her recently, but that makes more sense."

"For sure~" (Byakko)

"Hmm, that probably factors in, too. She is helping out a lot recently, isn't she? More people might be knowing how nice she can be." (Eleanor)

"True!" (Violet) "Also, she contrasts a lot with how Thana seems like pure lust, right? Even if you don't like her, you'd probably want her to be your big sister and all."

"For sure~" (Byakko) "I want her to be my mom~"

"You already said that." (Eleanor)

"I sure did~" (Byakko)

"...But yeah, you're right. Honestly, all of that probably has a hand in her being that popular."

"Yep."

"So~" (Byakko) "I think it's a shame Aya isn't a boy, Eleanor is most fond of Daryl and Violet is most fond of Junie?~"

"I guess." (Eleanor)

"Yep!"

"Ehh~" (Byakko) "Thana really is irrelevant nowadays, huh?~"

"Yeah."

"Yep."
