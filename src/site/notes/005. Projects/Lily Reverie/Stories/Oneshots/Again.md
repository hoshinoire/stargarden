_Again._

_Again, again, again._

_Those fuckers are making fun of me again, aren’t they? Just look at their faces, the mean looks they give me from time to time. Listen to their laugh. Actually, heck, I heard they say my name. And they came provoke me just a few days ago for the billionth time… Everyday this bullshit. And I thought getting good grades would get me a bit of respect around here, like it happened at middle school._

_I want to tell them to fuck off so, so much. Fucking. Idiots._

I stared down at my own desk, clenching my fists under it. Not very far off, a group of three girls were having a seemingly mean-spirited talk, always giving glances at me.

_I’m so tired from all of this shit… And I’m so pathetic I can’t take any action against it, even though this has been going on for a month already… I wish I could be like Kiana, she sure made those subhumans regret everything on the last chapter. Man, that chapter sure was great. But ah well, I’m not like her, in the end.  
_

I sighed.

_Ha, if this was online, I’d be showing those normalfags. Oh, I’d roast them so fucking hard. I’d make them regret all this stuff. I could start off my rant with something really sarcastic, maybe. Maybe my rant could go something like ‘How wonderful, you guys–‘_

_…Hm?_

A girl, who just entered the classroom, passed by close to the trio, trying to get to her own desk. She was a lamia, with yellow scales and a long, light blonde hair. Her eyes were red and she had a straight… half-bang? It only covered her left eye, anyway. The trio stopped her, saying hello, and it turned into a quartet.

_That’s… Scarlett, right? The popular as fuck girl. Probably the most popular first year right now. Heh, basically my opposite, huh? Even in grades. Heheh. And for sure, she is basically the normie queen. And I’m a master outcast._

_But great. Even to her they going to badmouth me now, right? And now even her is going to make fun of me. Just great. Very great.  
_

_Look. She just gave a glance at me. And they are laughing. See? Confirmed. How can Mae call me a pessimist if most shit I think actually confirms itself? I mean, I’m sure if I was with her now, she would just go ‘maybe not, you’re just too negative, Ori’ or something like that._

_Actually, fuck this shitty lunch break that seems to go on forever._

I picked my phone.

_I’m just going to mess on it. Better than keep paying attention and thinking about those imbeciles. I’m just going to get stressed._

_Let’s see…_

_Oh, Mae was online 20 minutes ago. I’ll try sending her something, she usually replies at this hour. Let’s see, let’s see… ‘Yo Mae, you there?’ Now just send–_

“Hey there!”

I jumped up. _Holy shit, that scared me._

Leaning on the right side my desk, was that very same popular girl from before. Scarlett. Her right hand was on my desk, and giving a quick look at it, I could notice it had a few yellow scales on it’s backside. She was looking at me smiling. It was a… rather cute smile, I’ll give her that. Her canines teeth were a bit big, in a cute way. _Maybe because she is a poisonous lamia so something with prey and…?  Eh._

“…It’s rude not to answer, you know.” She joked.

“A-ah. Um. H-hello…?”

_What does she want…_

“Yep, hello!” She said, cheerfully looking in my eyes. I avoided the eye contact, though. “You probably already know that, but… Name’s Scarlett!”

_What the hell does she want… Nothing good, I’m sure… They were badmouthing me to her, and then she comes talk with me? Of course this is going to be bad. If only this was fiction, where people are miraculously nice._

“Y-yeah, I know…” I said, sheepishly. “Ah, I’m…”

“Azure, right?”

_Ahhh. Of course she knows my name. They should’ve been saying it non-stop, after all. Now I must sound like an idiot as well, trying to tell her what my name is._

“Yeah…” I said, giving a quick glance at the trio, who was quietly staring at us two, and went back to looking at Scarlett. Not her eyes, though. Of course not.

“…Ah, it’s not what you think. I’ve actually known your name for a long time. Your grades are great! Way better than mine, ahaha.” She laughed.

_Huh, she noticed I thought it had something to do with them? That’s kind of nice of her, I guess. Good observational skills too. Anyway, well, but of course. My grades are my saving grace, otherwise I’d be basically nonexistant. People only know me because of my grades._

“I-I see. Thanks…?”

_How am I even supposed to answer that, though? Did I answer right…? That probably sounded awkward as fuck…_

_Well, I AM awkward as fuck._

“Hey, wanna be friends?” She said with a nice, peaceful smile, looking at my eyes. She seemed genuine about that, somehow.

“S-sure?”

_I still don’t get what she wants. Is this some kind of ploy to get close to me to make fun of me or something? She was with the bullies, after all. And she just randomly came talk to me._

_Maybe good souls like I see in fiction sometimes exist._

_…Who am I kidding. Of course not. I shouldn’t get my hopes up. Nor lower my guard much. But, well… Let’s see where this ends up… I’ll try not to be too pessimistic about it, even if I’m not optimistic, either._

“Nice!” She took both of my hands, and flinched for a second. And only then I noticed I was shaking. _Fuck. I probably seem so pathetic right now._ Scarlett did an empathetic expression, looking at my hands and then at me again. She seemed incredibly warm at that moment. “…Hey, give me your contact info!” She released my hands, and took out her own cellphone out of her skirt’s pocket. She stretched her arm in my direction, handing out it.

_Oh. Maybe, just maybe… Maybe she isn’t a bad person._

“O-okay.” I picked the cellphone, and put in my info, quickly giving it back to her.

“Nice!’ She picked her cellphone back. “I’m gonna send you a message later, ‘kay?”

The bell rang.

_Finally._

“Uh, alright.”

“Ohhh, your picture…” She muttered, thought I could still hear it. _Huh? She recognizes where the fanart is from? …Or she is weirded out. I dunno._ “Well, I hope we can be good friends! …Nah, I’m sure we will be! See ya, Azu!~” She got up, leaving my desk and going to her own.

_A-azu…? Isn’t she getting too intimate too fast…? Only Cinalum calls me that, and we know each other since we were children… Oh, and my parents. Actually, what the fuck was all that? …Well, I guess she isn’t the most popular girl for nothing. I bet she is so popular, talking with me won’t harm her reputation at all. Somehow._

I picked my cellphone again to put it under the desk, as class was going to start. Just then, I noticed I hadn’t sent the message to Mae. And also noticed I was finally stopping to tremble.

_Hm, I’ll change the message a bit and send it. And then I’ll put my cellphone away already._

‘Yo Mae, you there? I’m kinda busy rn, but I have some good stuff to tell you’

I send the message, smiling slightly as I put away the phone.
