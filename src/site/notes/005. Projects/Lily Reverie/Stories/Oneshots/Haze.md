Stepping stones heading into water. Or are they...? The mist is so strong, I can't look ahead. In the middle of the path I stand, yet, it's impossible to turn back, for those stones' existence is no more.

At this moment of my life, I feel utterly lost. Ubiquitous fog. Perhaps that's the first moment I'm thrown in such disarray: I've always had my eyes set on the horizon. The prize. The goal. My dream. But as the figure I once pursued doesn't exist anymore, wherever shall I go?

...

Wasteful. Stupe, even.

What a sinking feeling. Maybe worse than that of being stranded in life was that of discovering that my whole life of research was constructed on faulty, untruthful premises. Why, the basis of what I considered the world was false. The common sense fed to us when we were still critters was, after all, just an illusion to trap us into ignorance.

...hah. I'm probably not making any sense. But this situation doesn't make any sense either.

Maybe Aura is right. Just throwing yourself into hedonism to cope, that'd be no more futile than an entire lifetime researching magic like I did. Right now, I can't even feel any semblance of happiness for acquiring the capacity to cast spells. What an unsatisfying feeling. What a meaningless manner to have reached my life's dream. And to think it was impossible after all and Aura could only do it because she was, in all actuality, a human. What was the point of investing so much of my life in this worthless pursuit, in the end?

Weren't I so numb right now, maybe I'd get pissed. Yet my heart is frozen solid.

Most of all, I just want to find a shiny star in the sky. Oh, bright star... Won't you show me what direction should I head towards?

...

Sigh.
