**Dahlia - succubus**
(Links)

> Daryl’s twin sister and the leader of a notorious group of bullies at school, supposedly a bitch. Actually just a very nice girl, but who has shitty circumstances.
> 
> While Daryl is feeded by love, Dahlia is feeded by hate. She is also a cupid hybrid, but since she really doesn’t want to make people hate each other or mess with that kind of thing, she completely abstains from creating discord between people, just feeding from whatever naturally is there. However, she still can have very much the same health issues as Daryl and any other succubus, and does in fact get sick more frequently than Daryl, as her feeding isn’t as stable as her sister’s. What Dahlia does to get feeded but not hurt anyone is faking bullying: she decides on a popular girl with many friends that is visibly a nice person, then talks to her in private and tries to explain the situation in the most understandable way possible, they then come up with names she can call the other person in public or what bullying she can do, meaning everything is completely staged. So, in conclusion, the “bullied” girl doesn’t get hurt by Dahlia’s actions, and you might ask, what even is the point then? The point is that the bullied girl doesn’t hate Dahlia, but her friends do, as they don’t know it’s a staged thing.
> 
> Despite all this, Dahlia isn’t a complete loner however and her two friends, Thana and Medea, are considered part of her bully group. Truly, Medea does help out, though Thana mostly just hangs around with them.
> 
> Very kind and tends to act like a mother to her friends. She loves fashion and always tries to pick her clothes as carefully as possible.
