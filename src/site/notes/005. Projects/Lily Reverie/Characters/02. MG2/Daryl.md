**Daryl - succubus**
(links)

> The Student Council’s vice-president, one of the delinquents at the school and also Dahlia’s twin sister.
> 
> To be more accurate, Daryl is a cupid/succubus hybrid, one that is feeded by love specifically. Without getting into spoiler territory nor going too much in detail about worldbuilding, this means that she needs people being attracted to her OR seeing couples/people in love OR sex, otherwise anyone of her species get very sickly and has something akin to AIDs. Succubi have a terrible reputation in-universe, however, being considered fake and manipulative people for obvious reasons, which made Daryl give up on going for a “I’m a cute sweetie” appeal. Instead, she went full-power on the “liking a succubus is bad and wrong”, and decided to take up the persona of a delinquent, albeit a slightly flirty one. It works.
> 
> The true Daryl is actually a very chill and somewhat introverted person, preferring to be alone most of the time, and is also very responsible and competent. Her way of speaking is very unstable, with her mixing up her original way of speaking [somewhat polite, even formal, but mostly normal] and the delinquent speech she forces herself to use. But you know the kind of “becoming the mask” bullshit? Daryl’s natural speech and even way of acting [like walking and so on] is slowly becoming delinquent-like as well, which brings her much embarrassment. So if Daryl slips up and says delinquent lingo in a context where it’s ok for her to be normal? She’s guaranteed to go beet red if someone notices and teases her for it. Maybe even if they don’t.
> 
> She hates being a succubus and honestly wishes she was any other species, especially since it’s not just her health issues that end up being annoying but also interacting with others: people either avoid and treat her badly because she is a succubus, or have the hots for her due to her being a succubus, so no one sees her as Daryl, the person, just as a succubus instead.
> 
> One of the few people that are more or less close to Scarlett and they’re both themselves each other, mostly because Daryl quickly noticed that Scarlett was faking and confronted her about it, meanwhile Daryl isn’t as stuck-up about breaking her own persona.
> 
> Never fell in love and is very jaded in regards to it.
