**Konin - bunny girl [giant bunny]**

> The Student Councilâ€™s secretary, unanimously considered a lovable weirdo by everyone at school. Also a tall giant because of her species, having motherfucking 190cm.
> 
> Konin is severely lacking in common sense, but is very kind and friendly, plus a cheerful person overall and not to mention extremely competent with excellent grades, so no one can really bring themselves to dislike and much less hate her. Most of her lack of common sense stems from being homeschooled AND very sheltered prior to transferring to the Academy, especially since her basis for reality was heavily influenced by fiction [in her case, specifically yuri, so yes, she is a yurifag] so that led to very skewed views. Still, a good person, just weird.
> 
> The other cause of people finding her to be weird is how intense she gets about her interests, which she will get VERY pumped up about and ramble non-stop, though once again most people just find it endearing and cute. Her main interests are yuri and studying species, with the one that fascinates her the most being succubi, so you can imagine who she ends up pestering a lot.
