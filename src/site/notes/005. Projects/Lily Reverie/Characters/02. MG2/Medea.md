**Medea - arachne**

> Part of the group of so-called bullies and the resident true waifufag™. The only arthropod monster girl at school [worldbuilding reasons], which initially made people either be scared of her, disgusted by her or try to bully her. Nowadays everyone is just scared of her and leaves her alone.
> 
> Actually surprisingly outgoing, though she usually just interacts with her friends and some people on the Internet since there’s prejudice against her species. Not like she is super social, either. So down-to-earth you sometimes forget she has a waifu and is completely serious about it. Very sarcastic [to the point of sometimes being a bit of an asshole] and loves to tease her friends, with her victim most frequently being Thana. Thana and Medea have something akin to a Boke and Tsukkomi routine, respectively.
> 
> Good at being scary and intimidating who she needs to, which is how she made all the bullies go completely away. And if people still try to mess with her despite that, Medea can and will doxx and/or blackmail the person who tries it. Also kind of perceptive. She’s also a bit of a hipster.
