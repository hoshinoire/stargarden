**Lana - centaur (llama)**

> Absolutely fluffy, her fur is pink and she is so adorable! Surely a very nice and kind teacher, no? Well, as you can guess from my sarcastic tone, yeah, she isn’t. Actually, this is probably something she’d say herself. Anyway, despite the apparently very cute appearance, she is quite serious and almost strict as a teacher, though she is easygoing outside of work. Probably the most sarcastic among the teachers and can be a little cold, even grumpy. Doesn’t have a high tolerance for bullshit. She is perceptive of her own students’ behavior, however, and she still isn’t to the point of being a bitch or anything like that. Somewhat mysterious, seeing as how no one knows much about her and she avoids talking about herself. She supervises the troublemaker half of the Socialization Club, so she belongs more in the MG2 category rather than the teacher one. Pretty confident, but doesn’t know if she is happy she looks cute [she agrees that she does] or if the whole thing is just a complete annoyance since people assume she is nice and no, she isn’t.
