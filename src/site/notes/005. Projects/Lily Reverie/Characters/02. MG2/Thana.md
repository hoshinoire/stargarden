**Thana - bat girl** (slightly outdated)

> Her name comes from Thanatos and one of her moms still calls her that in private, but Medea prefers to call her Thanathot. Why? Because she is a horny motherfucker [not literally, she is more of a teacherfucker] who already had sex with a lot of the girls at the Academy. She has a pretty face, is good at seducing and has the guts to pursue sex, plus is actually considered likable even being part of the bully group because she has an ungodly amount of charisma. Now a 3rd year and her popularity is far from being at the peak ever since Aya began studying at the Academy, however. Still kinda popular and gets laid regularly. She’s not like the “I wouldn’t go out with a ugly girl. Why? Because they don’t exist” because she’s actually more like “I wouldn’t have sex with a ugly girl. Why? Because they don’t exist.” Especially because she doesn’t want to date anyone, just have sex.
> 
> She LOVES the city since it’s chock full of monster girls and so there’s so much variety in sex for her to pick from and interesting things to do, though she also seems to have a genuine interest in biology that she doesn’t realize herself. Can a monster girl have a fetish for monster girls? If yes, yeah, Thana has one.
> 
> A bit hyperactive and genki, good at studying but irresponsible when it comes to anything else. She is a bit immature and argumentative sometimes, plus holds no respect for authority or anything except her two moms [she’s right tho, her mothers’ rage is satanic]. I really recommend going to the pairing section and reading the first chapter of her story since I think it showcases Thana’s personality better than any description of her ever will.
> 
> She’s starting to change a bit now, though, because she’s actually falling in love for the first time in her whole life, which is something she doesn’t really know how to deal with and transforms her into a blushing mess. She can’t even flirt properly with her crush without dying from embarrassment anymore. Love is a powerful thing, isn’t it?

**Other desc (new)**

* A bat monster girl who has been repeating her grade for some years already, considered almost a monument of the academy at this point. It'd actually be better if she was just stupid, considering her actual motivation...
* Most people don't know as this is confidential information and just assume she was adopted, but she is the biological child of a lesbian couple, a feat managed through much magic and science. Her mothers are Minerva (a vampire) and Celene (a bat girl), Celene being the one who gave birth to her, although they aren't together nowadays. Sees Celene from time to time and lives with Minerva nowadays, who also teaches at the academy.
* Very infamous due to her hedonism and constantly chasing girls, particularly since she's never looking for romantic entanglements and instead is always simply going after sex. Very promiscuous and somehow has a legitimate monster girl fetish. I guess she invented a new meaning to sex tourism, huh?
* Currently part of the "delinquent" clique. Doesn't do much delinquent-wise other than assisting in certain moments though.
* Doesn't hold much respect for authorities (other than her mothers, that is).
* Enthusiastic, somewhat genki, very impulsive and tends to just blurt out things, even when very inappropriate.
* Actually quite bright, just repeatedly fails her grades so she gets one extra year to know more monster girls and, uh, interact with them.
* Actually somewhat praise hungry and especially latches to Dahlia (who she treats as a big sister) to ask for praise.
* Although most of her interest in other monster girl species indeed stem from, ahem, carnal desires, she has a legitimate interest in monster biology in general. Even repeating grades on purpose for the millionth time, she has never once scored badly in biology-related classes. Loves to understand all the various ways monsters' bodies work and the nearly infinite variations of ways a monster's body can be, even in the same species. And I mean the body in general, not just the private parts. Yes, really. Yes, I'm still talking about Thana.
* Since her mothers are unsure if she'll be normally healthy or get a normal lifespan thanks to being fruit of an experiment, both of them have always encouraged her to live life to the fullest and the best way she can.
* Her popularity at school is... Complicated, so to say. She's mostly well-liked and considered charismatic, but not so much in a "girls are into her" kind of way. Although she scores regularly and is capable (?) flirting-wise, her fame of being a womanizer ~ too promiscuous precedes her, so she has no serious admirers at all, as much as her sexual life is very active. Not that she minds, seeing how she genuinely has a very hard time feeling romantic feelings.
* Actually surprisingly a very good friend and in her weird way she's almost caring, loyal even.
* When not pursuing erotic matters, actually does quite a bit of other activities and even enjoys reading.
