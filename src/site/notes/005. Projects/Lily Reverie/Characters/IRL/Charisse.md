**Charisse (Care)**

> What if God was a mentally ill apathetic depressed horny internet dweller hikikomori woman? This is what happens: Charisse, the caretaker of LiRe’s world.
> Initially just extremely depressed and lonely, even suicidal, and then took up the task of taking care of that world, which managed to give her life meaning, even more so after being able to observe that the ones who live in that world treat her as a goddess. So it ends up being the one amazing thing only she could do and that makes her think it’s worth it to keep going, even if she’s still depressed regardless. The radiation/magic took it’s toll on both her body [which Mag fixed] and mind though, so she went slightly insane and for better or for worse, her social anxiety ended up inexistent. How many cigarettes per day do you believe is too much? Whatever the answer, Care probably smokes the quintuple of that. She sure is lucky to be immortal now.
