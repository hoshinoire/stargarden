**Alys** (kinda outdated+incomplete)

> Still not very developed, but she has a huge fascination with magic and used to have an immense frustration with the fact she was unable to cast spells due to her species, which was part of what Mag offered her so she would join her on her trip to real life. Kinda a normal girl, I guess? Gets mad and embarrassed easily though, and is very knowledgeable about both magic and illusionism.
