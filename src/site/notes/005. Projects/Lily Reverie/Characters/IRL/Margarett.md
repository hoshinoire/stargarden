**Margarett (Mag)**

> The personification of magic itself, so much that magic is literally the root of her name. Yet, a controversial figure in LiRe’s world: some see her as a goddess, others as some sort of Satan, and most as something in-between. A classic trickster goddess, albeit a probably more evil version of one. Most of the bad or questionable things she did she claims it was because it seemed interesting or fun, and most of the good things she does are supposedly to make up for the bad ones. And then other actions of hers are simply incomprehensible and nobody has any idea if it was good or bad to begin with. Doesn’t seem capable of taking anything or any consequences seriously.
> Deeply in love with Care since the beginning of times. What does she see in Care, you ask? Don’t ask me, she is the personification of magic, I can’t fathom understanding her brain, too.
