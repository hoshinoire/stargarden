For better or for worse, the most popular girl of the Academy at the moment, also quite notorious so it’s not exclusively the good type of popularity. Regardless, she has a gigantic harem~club of fangirls just because she is androgynous, has a nice face and to top it off she manages to both hit on people and act princely completely accidentally. Actually nicknamed the prince of the school, though certain circles call her “the idiot prince” instead and fans attracted to her past like to call her “the pirate prince”. This is because she used to be a pirate before coming to the Academy, but fled from her old life and no one knows how the fuck she was accepted into the Academy, since she is a poorfag and it’s a school for richfags. She still has a bit of a pirate accent that mostly shows up in emotionally charged moments like when she is very pumped up about something, very embarrassed and so on.

And indeed, she is either a complete idiot or a genius. You could make up a theory that she is trolling and her behavior is fake, but the girl is actually incapable of lying due to her questionable intelligence and is way too genuine, she wouldn’t be able to troll for this long at all. She is mostly very friendly and is also very hyper, a legitimate genki girl. Especially when she starts talking about topics that excite her a lot, like: the occult, dark magic, conspiracy theories and big tits. In fact, she is completely obsessed with the first three and once she starts talking about them, she won’t shut up.

Aya is pretty much a conspiracy theory chuuni, sometimes believing and saying that a certain entity might be going after her or that she was enlightened with true knowledge, so she has the duty of spreading redpills for the uninformed ones. Most surely is the LiRe equivalent of a flat earther. She’s also a chuuni in regards to the occult and dark magic, but she’s nowhere as loud about that one as she is about the conspiracies. After all, people don’t need to know your ties to hellish things, but redpilling people is a must! According to her, of course. Most probably already made a kabedon with a girl who has the hots for her just to utter something that sounds like “you know… you’re… you’re special, so I’m gonna tell you something that must be a secret between us…”, lean in to whisper in the girl’s ear and then say “...succubi did 9/11.” Tends to hold some prejudice against the species the theories she heard say are bad, mainly kitsunes (or any shapeshifter tbh, but specially kitsunes) and succubi.

The kind of girl that when clearly in love would act more or less like a deredere and might even explicitly say something about dating, even marriage, but still don’t quite get herself that is in-love somehow and will only understand it if someone explicitly mentions it to her. And then she will actually have a meltdown and get surprisingly shy about it.

Her grades are… Sometimes good, sometimes shit. She sometimes relies on tarot or other occultic things saying it’ll help her discover what are the answers of the test. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. Has started to ask for help studying though because her situation sometimes borders on worrisome.

No one knows how the fuck did she lose her left eye. Actually, no one even knows if she really lost it to begin with. Doesn’t fly and refuses to answer why. Takes a lot of booze to manage to get her drunk, and when she gets drunk she turns into a rational, calm, down-to-earth person AKA she is more sober then than when she is actually sober.
