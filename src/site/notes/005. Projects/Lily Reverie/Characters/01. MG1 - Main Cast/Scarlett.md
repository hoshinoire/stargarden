The Student Council President. A very charismatic and nice girl, super social and even gorgeous! Also very much a hard worker, so much that her grades suffer because of it and it’s hard to get close to her since she is very busy. All-in-all, a big role model and nearly a perfect girl, a true ojousama!

At least, that’s her persona, though at least the ojousama bit is true since she is probably among the richest of richfags of the school. The true Scarlett is apathetic as hell, doesn’t care much for many things and actually legit doesn’t like 98% of the people of the Academy, actually, she finds nearly everyone garbage normalfags, normalfags being something she truly loathes. Not everyone, she has exceptions and also people she is very much neutral towards, but still holds this opinion about a large part of the student body. And as you might’ve noticed already, she has a bit of a sharp tongue and says/thinks some pretty mean stuff. Actually uses the StuCo position a lot as a way to avoid normalfags using the excuse of being too busy, plus to excuse her slacking and getting worse grades. She’s actually lazy as hell and doesn’t do almost anything at the Student Council, with most tasks going to the other three members, especially Daryl and Konin. But don’t get her wrong, this was all a spoiler-ish scheme they came up with together, so it’s not particularly that Scarlett is being a lazy bitch. All the task delegation is consented.

Nearly no one truly knows how the real Scarlett is, with [[005. Projects/Lily Reverie/Characters/01. MG1 - Main Cast/Azure\|Azure]] knowing her the best by far. [[005. Projects/Lily Reverie/Characters/02. MG2/Daryl\|Daryl]] and [[005. Projects/Lily Reverie/Characters/02. MG2/Konin\|Konin]] know about her true personality too, but are far from being as close to Scarlett as Azure is. A few people do suspect something is wrong with Scarlett, though. She’s also a huge [closet] yurifag and also a huge [also closet] otaku, being even good at drawing things in anime style, but she never draws in front of anyone that doesn’t know how she truly is. Spends most of her free time doing something related to anime or yuri. Doesn’t even interact much with other people online because she tends to find most people kind of uninteresting, so she tends to stick to doing her own things and mostly lurking.

Even though she puts up such a social persona and doesn’t exactly have problems with anxiety per se, she’s actually very uncomfortable around most people, even more so socializing, but she tries her best to not let her discomfort be noticeable. Still has trouble approaching others, because as much as she manages to force herself to seem social, her discomfort still wins over impersonation skills sometimes. Also finds most socialization very tiresome. Perhaps as a consequence of the way she chose to live, she has an absolutely hard time understanding her own feelings and rarely does. Gets embarrassed and awkward expressing her genuine feelings, too: being affectionate to strangers as an act is fine, but being affectionate to someone she truly cares for is embarrassing as fuck. Deep down she is just an extremely awkward and actually introverted girl that managed to create a persona and act well. Not really that different from Azure internally.

Fantasizes about yuri in her own mind and doesn’t pay attention to her own surroundings at all. Sometimes reads yuri manga but covers it up to seem like she is reading some Student Council document, and to this day nobody has ever figured it out. Wants to fall in love someday.
