Not particularly anything at school: not specially beloved by teachers, not on the StuCo, not hated by everyone, not royalty, not the owner of a harem, not a delinquent, not bullied. Akatai is just a loner by her own choice who prefers to do her own thing by herself. Other than being childhood friends with [[005. Projects/Lily Reverie/Characters/01. MG1 - Main Cast/Juniper\|Junie]], she’s polite with strangers and has a few acquaintances to whom she can ask things (like class notes, homework and so on) whenever she does need it. Some girls already tried to befriend her and Junie tried to introduce Akatai to a few groups of girls she was fond of, but Akatai always ends up going “nah thx” (more accurately, mentally she goes “lol a bunch of normies, no thank you”) in a polite way and stays by herself since she prefers to play her games in peace. Even something that’s going on with a group of people is interesting, she prefers to stay simply as an outsider observer. In other words, she just wants to see the world burn from a distance. Junie is her only real life friend, all her other friends are from the Internet.

Very chill, by far the chillest person of this cast even, maybe even kinda apathetic. When she _does_ get mad her rage is pretty fucked up though, but it’s so rare to happen that even Junie hasn’t seen many occasions of it. Most of the time she won’t care for whatever bullshit you’re saying and will leave and make fun of you later instead of arguing, too, as she tends to avoid conflict unless she finds it necessary. Very frequently kind of sleepy too and can also be pretty grumpy. Has some random energy peaks though and when she does her energy rivals that of a genki girl, though definitely not as loud because she is still pretty introverted regardless. So she basically has two modes, low energy (sleepy, grumpy, apathetic, and/or chill) and high energy (hyper, agitated, genki-ish), with no in-between energy mode.

Also extremely lazy, which applies mostly to her low energy mode but honestly? She doesn’t get shit done in her high energy mode either. Almost gets fucked because of her grades all the time and who saves her is almost always Junie, who’s not very responsible herself so Akatai really is a little shit when it comes to studying. She’s a 3rd year but doesn’t have much idea of what she wants to do after finishing the Academy, since she has absolutely no focus and way too many interests, but also can’t see her doing or working with anything for a long time. Very level-headed and tends to be realistic, also her bullshit filters are high but she entertains stupid ideas (which she herself deems stupid) all the time just because they’re fun or messing with the person who said it is fun. And yes, as you can expect, she’s a troll, though she almost exclusively trolls online since IRL she’s still a quiet and awkward girl even if she’s kinda cool and so the only one she feels comfortable trolling IRL is Junie and her family. Very much an Internet dweller and likes games a lot. Also likes running and playing the drums. As I said, she has no focus. Gets distracted easily, too.

Doesn’t tank compliments at all. Also not a very affectionate person herself, but it’s not hard to notice if she cares for someone or not going by her behavior alone and she is pretty loyal to those she cares for. Tends to express some real feelings of her as if they were irony and get surprised when someone catches on that it’s not a joke. Not that she’s good at understanding her own feelings, anyway.

I swear she isn’t supposed to be my self-insert. Really. I'm too busy self-inserting in other OCs nowadays. Might be considered LiRe’s mascot, tho.
