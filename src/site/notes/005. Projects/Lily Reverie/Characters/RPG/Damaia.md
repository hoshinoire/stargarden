**Damaia “Jahi” Mastema - demon girl**

> Very rough and talks in an aggressive, vulgar way, plus gets irritated/frustrated very easily, which the fact she gets frequently teased for being short definitely doesn’t help. Also somewhat bossy, bitter and grumpy. She’s actually a good person with a good heart and has very low tolerance for bullshit, but considering that bullshit is one of the things that happen the most in that team and she is already bitter by nature, it’s to be expected her mood is even shittier than if she was with average, run-of-the-mill people. Of course she is a tsundere, you don’t need to ask. Once in a blue moon she mentions some fantasy of being an overlord.
> She’s actually pretty mature and wise, being particularly insistent on the idea of self-improvement, but sometimes her immaturity slips, especially when it comes to her sweet tooth. At least half of the team doesn’t take her seriously though and just teases her. And if you are imagining someone teasing her, Damaia getting mad and the person holding her by the horns and laughing… That’s accurate. She frequently makes comments about hating the team or most of them being terrible, but deep down she cares for everyone there.
> Actually very competent when relaying orders to others so she being bossy isn’t completely off-the-mark, so much that for team tactics everyone [except the most unruly ones like Tsubaki and Arielle] relies on her.
> Always complains that cigarettes don’t exist in LiRe’s world, but is glad that at least booze does exist.

Alt desc:
* Speaks in a rough manner, is kind of vulgar and uncultured, somewhat aggressive. Lowkey tsundere-ish. Actually just afraid of letting people in and is a very soft person/a sweetheart otherwise. Tries to act mean and to prank, sometimes just gives up because she she regrets it midway. Complex about being short. Kind of childish and has a sweet tooth. Honestly the one with best morals after Bea.
