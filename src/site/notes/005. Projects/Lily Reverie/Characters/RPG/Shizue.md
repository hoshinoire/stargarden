**Shizue - yuki-onna/elf**

> Tsubaki might be more openly an asshole, but Shizue? You don’t want to mess with her, trust me. By far the most dangerous member of the team, at least if you consider matters not exclusive to battling. Most yuki-onnas tend to prove that the “they’re truly cold people and it’s not just their temperature” stereotype that floats around in that world is a lie, but Shizue proves it. Not that you’d think so knowing her at surface level, since she has a warm, composed and even classy exterior. But she isn’t a complete bitch as she still has some standards and genuinely loves the people she cares for. What standards? I don’t know, but she has some.
> She’s a HUGE schemer and has a lot of contacts, herself being especially involved with what is vaguely called the “underworld”, which isn’t illegal per se but full of questionable things and no one knows much about except those who participate in it, and she also seems to have certain ties to the black market, but no one knows to what degree she’s in it. Loves gambling and making bets.
> She won’t screw your life over because of little things, though. She’ll only do more extreme things, and won’t hesitate to, if you do more fucked up things to her or people she cares about. The worst thing she might do to someone who never did anything to her or those she cares about is blackmailing.
> Kind of pretty smug sometimes.

Alt desc:
* Calm, steady, elegant, actually cold as fuck and a bitch but doesn't seem so much like that. Highly ambitious, has ties to the underworld. Intimidating as hell while speaking in the most soft voice. Could get you executed if she wanted. But kind of nice if you don't upset her.
