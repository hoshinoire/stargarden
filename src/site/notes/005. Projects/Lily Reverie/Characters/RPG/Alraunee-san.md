**“Alraunee-san” - alraune (lily)**

> Still unnamed tbh but probably really is called Alraunee-san in-universe.
> The resident motherly yurifag of the team! Because no all-girl team is complete without one, right? She mostly stays just at the base and provides for medical care and healing, plus takes care of it whenever all the other members of the team leave together for a mission or expedition. Literally asked to join the team because she noticed it was all-girls and the girls were visibly into girls, so it was pretty much her dream of being surrounded by yuri couples IRL. Her only condition was that she asked the team leader to never let a male join the team because she doesn’t want guys in her own personal yuri paradise. The leader, Eryn, accepted since it’s a pretty whatever thing and it’s cheaper AND more effortless to have the alraune providing healing rather than buying potions or gathering resources and brewing them. Other than her obsession with lesbianism, she is actually pretty down-to-earth and mature.
> Very doting and tends to also do the cooking, honestly acting like a mother to everyone there.
> She’s said to be very strong, but prefers chilling and healing instead of being at the center of the action. Sometimes she says disturbing things cutely.
