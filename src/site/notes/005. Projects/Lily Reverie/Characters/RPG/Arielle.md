**Arielle - elf**

> A genki battle maniac ranger/hunter who gets super reckless and agitated when anything battle-related comes up, possibly [probably] addicted to the adrenaline of battling. Any other time? Probably sleepy or daydreaming and not paying attention to anything at all, so much that sometimes she suddenly says something completely off-the-field that confuses everyone except Hilda, and even then she manages to confuse Hilda sometimes. So yeah, very airheaded outside battle and has quite the weird train of thought. So much you can’t even tell properly if she is dumb or actually smart.
> Outside daydreaming she is actually quite a nice and charismatic friendly person, especially if you somehow actually do interest her, though that is not very common. She’ll still be an airhead though. Gets along well with animals.
> Wants to battle at least once with basically everybody she meets and isn’t a sore loser at all. And if you’re weak, she’ll probably genuinely try to help you improve because she wants to have a thrilling battle with the strong version of you too. Plus she enjoys teaching others how to battle in general, but she doesn’t realize [or maybe doesn’t want to admit] that she has that motivation as well.
> Proud of her skills, but not to the point of arrogance.

Alt desc:
* Genki battle maniac, actually nice and sucks at lying but otherwise extremely reckless and doesn't seem to care much about morals. Isn't exactly dumb, but always daydreaming if not battling. Very well liked in some cities because she miraculously has charisma and her hunting skills being a huge help sometimes.
