**Adrian - nekomimi/cat síth girl**

> Genki reverse trap who seems like a nice person but in all honesty is manipulative as fuck, tends to seduce others for her own personal gain and uses her androgynous appearance to her advantage, though she envies Beatrice for being a scylla since most of the people in that universe seem to have a fetish for scyllas. She is very playful with the people she actually cares for [tl;dr the team] and can be both very affectionate and very protective of them. Likes to do friendly bullying sometimes, especially with Damaia. Kind of hates Tsubaki.
> Finds stealing honestly very fun and doesn’t seem to understand that crimes and manipulation are both bad things, or maybe just doesn’t care. Some of the girls have already noticed that Adrian sometimes lets it slip that she is smarter than she lets on.
> Very curious and impulsive, which sometimes leads the team to trouble and sometimes manages to get them a treasure they wouldn’t have stumbled on otherwise. Disappears completely sometimes.
