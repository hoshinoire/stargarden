**Eryn - elf**

> The team founder and also the team leader, plus the owner of their base of operations. Somewhat greedy, but as long as the team generates the desired amount of money and doesn’t get itself in serious trouble with the law or anything else, she doesn’t care. “You guys are horrible but at least you guys get me a nice amount of cash.”
> Other than money, she mostly just wants to be left in peace, which by itself constitutes 90% of what she believes is an ideal lifestyle. She’s kind of apathetic and claims to have seen way too much shit in life already, but avoids talking about it. Actually, she mostly avoids talking about herself in general. Not exactly a bad person though, just not really inclined to do nor bad nor good things, but at least she very occasionally does some of the latter. Which is more than Shizue does for sure.
> Hates pressure and being forced into anything, which is her main reason for not wanting to turn the team into a guild despite it already having the size to become one [she has more freedom running a team than a guild]. Very good at long-range combat, especially bows which she tends to use with the arrows she crafted herself. Crafting arrows and bows [and a few others weapons, but not many] is one hobby of hers and another one is brewing potions, most of them geared towards offensive tactics [e.g. she prefers brewing a poisonous potion and applying it to her arrows instead of brewing status healing potions]. Actually, she is generally more interested in offense than defense in general, which has something that fucked up the team sometimes when she was the one in-charge of tactics instead of Damaia.
> Pretty knowledgeable about LiRe’s world in general and is surprisingly well-liked by the people.
