**Beatrice - scylla/octopus girl** (might be somewhat outdated?)

> A true ojousama, including the elegance and the manners, although she hates her current body and thinks tentacles do not befit a lady of such class as her, much preferring she got turned into an elf instead. Tends to be polite even when she is actually being easygoing, although the team is slowly but surely corrupting her ways. Usually very patient, but all the bullshit and morally questionable things the team does make her act as if she had a short-fuse. Tries to make jokes sometimes, but her sense of humor is terrible.
> She’s an avid consumer of books and knows a very good amount of information, even though most of it is obsolete now that she isn’t in the human world anymore. Also the only one who seems very bothered by the fact she was isekai’d and has amnesia, actively wanting to pursue an answer for it all, though at the same time she is the one who is the most intrigued about LiRe’s world and wants to know more about it. Asks a lot of questions, being very curious about certain matters.
> Likes to get a reasonable amount of time alone. Slowly warming up to her octogirl body, finding that it’s utility MIGHT make up for how disgraceful tentacles are and how annoying the amount of girls who flock to her is. Another thing that is making her start to like her octogirl body is the fact that she is very, very far from having the purest of minds, which is something she tries to hide and well, she manages to. Doesn’t change the fact her mind is probably dirtier than how she thinks tentacles are.
