**Tsubaki (Kori Blanc) - kitsunemimi**

> By far the biggest asshole of the group. Very cold, only polite if there’s some benefit to it [so yes, she tends to respect Eryn], acts arrogantly as fuck and if you bother her? You’re fucked. May humiliate basically anyone if she thinks the person deserves it. Finds Adrian annoying and the two bicker a lot.
> Has some pretty bad trust issues and is very, very slowly defrosting to the team members, which leads to dorkish and awkward moments since her hidden side is way more clumsy than the composed asshole side of hers, though even her nice side is a bit of an ass and she is naturally not very expressive. 
> Tsubaki isn’t her real name; it’s actually Kori. However, she used to be a huge fucking otaku during her life as a human and when presented by a literal isekai situation, she picked up a Japanese name that she liked. Was also the one who gave Damaia the Jahi name suggestion, and yes, it’s a reference to you-know-what and she also tried to trick Damaia into picking up Satania as a name, which I’m sure I don’t even need to say if it’s a reference or not. Most of her behavior is her true personality, but honestly? Some of it is probably her LARPing as a kuudere anime girl she used to like. Still, it’s mostly true, just a lil’ bit of it is a LARP. And a bit of something else.
> Was very disappointed when she discovered light elves aren’t the titty monster anime told her they were and actually tend to be A cup or B cup, but some of her hope was restored when she met Hilda and saw Hilda’s Hildas. What she didn’t get over yet though was the fact anime doesn’t exist in the world where she now lives.
