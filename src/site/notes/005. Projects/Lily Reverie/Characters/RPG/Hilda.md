**Hilda - dark elf** (might be kinda outdated?)

> A cool, aloof and respected hunter with skills that indeed justify her reputation, yet very meek and shy outside battles and hunting. Hilda is a dark elf with many years of practice in hunting and battling with truly a passion for both, but for throwing herself so much at these her social skills suffered a lot, though she still says that battling someone is the best way to get to know them, whatever that means. Talking to strangers is scarier than taking down a dragon, in her opinion. Her favorite manner of hunting is by traps and using strategies, but make no mistake, if she actually needs to battle directly, she surely won’t be in a pinch, especially since she is always well-equipped. Always.
> Although still shy and very troubled by socialization, her social skills have been flourishing (extremely slowly) after she met Arielle and she ended up joining the team. She isn’t very frequently at the base however and spends most of her time hunting by herself or with Arielle. The two are in charge of security, with Hilda taking care particularly of traps and defense mechanisms.
> Very used to dark elves’ risqué way of dressing, she doesn’t understand why everyone finds being seminude (or even nude) so embarrassing, despite being the person of the team who gets embarrassed the most easily in any other situation.
