**Ciara - dullahan** {teacher}

> A war veteran and currently a history teacher. Very serious and tends to isolate herself, though everyone can clearly see she carries some sort of heavy sadness. And it’s true, since she lost her precious SO [a centaur] in a war they fought together, plus the overall toll that PTSD took on her. It’s visible, though, that underneath everything she is nevertheless a good person.
