**Eleanor - fairy**

> Excessively serious, even stuck-up, though she used to be way worse before and she is learning how to be chill thanks to her friend group [her, Violet and the tiger girl]. Tries to act mature but nobody takes her too seriously because of her size. Class rep. Has feelings for Elizabeth, both of the romantic kind and of pure, high admiration. Also has feelings for Elizabethâ€™s legs, stemming from both jealousy and a leg fetish.
