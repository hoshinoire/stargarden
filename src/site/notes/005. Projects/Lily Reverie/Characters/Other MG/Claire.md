**Claire - vampire**
(links)

> A gorgeous and young (?) vampire actress, beloved by many for her bubbly personality and cute looks.
> 
> Upon personal contact, depending of who you are her personality isn't as pretty as it looks. Petty, self-absorbed, narcissistic, obsessed with money and fame, low in morals. Thanks God she's stupid as fuck! If it's somehow useful for her she'll just be a nice and pleasant person, though.
> 
> Her most recent hijink was coming out as gay despite being a heterosexual (or so she believes) in search of getting more clout as her career seemed to stagnate, something she realized as during an outing nobody asked her for an autograph (gasp!). For extra clout points, she even got herself into a relationship with a fellow popular coworker of hers! And her fake girlfriend is an expert at pulling off the gig of being a convincing fake couple: kissing and having sex are all mandatory! Such a shame for [[005. Projects/Lily Reverie/Characters/Other MG/Indigo\|Indigo]], as a legitimate lesbian (unlike Claire, of course) she's wrapped up on Claire's little fingers and can't help but fall for the manipulation of the girl she loves.
> 
> But it's not Claire's fault everyone gets manipulated by her so easily! And she has goals to achieve! Sheesh.

Other desc:

* An actress that is very popular nowadays and recently attracted even more attention as she revealed to be in a relationship with another female actress, [[005. Projects/Lily Reverie/Characters/Other MG/Indigo\|Indigo]], who is also moderately famous
* Persona of being nice, sweet, overly cutesy
* Total narcissist and self-absorbed
* Way older than she looks (and acts), but don't ever talk about that or God forbid call her a hag
* Attention-whore obsessed with her own image
* Wants to get to the top of the success ladder at any cost, aims to be the most famous actress ever with an infinite reign of fame
* Part of her fame can be attributed to just how rare it is to have a vampire that can be captured by camera, plus overall pretty looks
* Manipulative and uses people for her own gain and goals, very result-oriented
* VERY dumb
* Upon seeing some fellow celebs coming out and researching on tabloid websites, commenters' valuable opinions led her to scientifically concluding that coming out is assured to garner attention and clout, even if you're actually cishet, which made her craft a devilish genious plan: claim to be a lesbian and fake a lesbian relationship!
* Believes herself to be heterosexual and that her lesbian claim is an absolute lie, has zero understanding about herself and her emotions 
* Very obviously attracted to Indigo and way too eager to engage in couple acts with her
* Has also experimented with girls in her past and had too many suspiciously close 'friendships' with girls in the past, to the point she actually had quite the fair amount of rumors about being a lesbian before her "fake" coming out (something she did take into account when crafting her master plan)
* Used to profusely deny being a lesbian when asked that before, still profusely denies internally
* Way less manipulative than she thinks herself to be: actually somewhat of a good person and does good deeds for others all the time, but she copes to herself that this was her somehow being manipulative and evil
* As the evil implies, yes, she might be a little bit of a... chuuni, or edgy, whatever
