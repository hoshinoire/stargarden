**Violet - cheetah girl**

> Has the brightest smile, but she certainly isn’t the brightest in regards to intelligence, though many argue that this just makes her even cuter. Popular at school for being very nice and cheery, plus having good looks, which she does, indeed, take very good care of. Was once bullied by Dahlia’s group. Pretty much a deredere.
