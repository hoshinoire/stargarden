**Byakko [white bengal]**

> Supposedly the token straight girl of the cast, but everyone and their moms know Iâ€™ll eventually end up attached to her when I develop her more and decide to give her a yuri pairing of her own. Very lazy and sleepy 24/7, seemingly only awake to make sarcastic quips at her best friends. No one understands how she gets such good grades despite that. Likes spiritual and supernatural things, sometimes offering things like tarot readings to her friends. A bit of a wingman for both her friends.
