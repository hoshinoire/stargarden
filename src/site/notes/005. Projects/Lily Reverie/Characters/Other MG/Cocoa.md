**Cocoa - werewolf girl [painted wolf/African wild dog]** (kinda outdated and also incomplete)
(Links)

> Lalin's ex and doesn't study at the Academy, but important nevertheless. A cheerful and extremely curious girl, she's actually pretty smart and perceptive but has a terrible attention span. Sometimes gets very into something and rants nonstop, but when not ranting tends to derail all the time. Sociable, but prefers to stay alone if she thinks someone isn't worth the trouble, though she is polite nevertheless and still gets lonely easily. Has a penchant for rule breaking, pranks and teasing. Has too many interests and knows too much useless trivia which constitute much of her derails, however sometimes it's not even something she particularly knows and rather just a generic philosophical musing out of nowhere. Confident and takes great care of her appearance and of her way of dressing. Can be very stubborn and argumentative when it comes to certain things. Fun to be around.
