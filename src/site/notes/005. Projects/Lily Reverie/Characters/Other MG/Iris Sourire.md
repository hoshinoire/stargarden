**Iris Sourire** - kitsune

* Not her real name; real name is ???
* [[005. Projects/Lily Reverie/Characters/01. MG1 - Main Cast/Akatai\|Akatai]]'s (much) older sister, although physically you can't notice the gap in age that much
* Much to Akatai's chagrin, really loves her little sister and is very touchy, not to mention clingy
* The favorite child of her parents, something they don't even try to hide by giving her a much fatter allowance than Akatai's
* Either has an incredible makeup game or an incredible babyface, seeming way younger than she is even for kitsune standards
* A very hard worker totally dedicated to her job, nearly a workaholic, her profession being scamming people coupled with doing additional odd but honorable jobs like blackmailing
* Legitimately not... A very good person
* Her specialty is a very complete act of faking to be a kid or, if shapeshifting isn't possible, seeming like a very young damsel in distress. Has done nearly every trick on the book though, from faking to be pregnant to seeming legitimately crazy, Iris has done it all! 
* Mostly actually scams and gets money out of it, but sometimes does it for shit and giggles too
* Seeing as Akatai is quite tech savvy, pesters her from time to time for technology tips... No, no, she doesn't have in mind scamming people through the internet, where did you get that idea?!
* Creates sometimes excessively elaborate characters just for some ruses of her and even tailors their appearances for her to shapeshift into, those characters of her being used, for example, in stunts like being a fleshtuber (ongoing) who also has a vtuber identity (ongoing), having a Instagram about her character's activities as a doctor and unknown medicinal tips (ended prematurely for dissemination of fake information), having an OnlyFans (ended after someone got too dependent on her, she thought it was hilarious but too troublesome to attend), being a street performer of absurd backstory (ongoing) and much more...
* When acting out her ruses, sometimes gets so into it she does something akin to method acting 
* Legitimately smart and cunning, for the disgrace of everyone else
* If she can smell the existence of some dirty, big secret... You can bet she's going to uncover it. And blackmail people with it. You're poor? Don't worry! You can always run errands for her like a slave~
* Likewise, always knows the latest and also the most obscure gossip of any place she frequents. Starting the gossip herself? Spreading it? Hm? I don't know what you're talking about!
* Never stays too much time in the same place and tends to move out all of a sudden. Likewise, she can appear all of a sudden too and it's nearly impossible to keep tabs on her properly
* Actually not really close to anyone else and nobody seems to know her all that well
* Even when being truthful she doesn't talk much about herself and nearly always seems somewhat mysterious
* Her two favorite toys nowadays are a cop she blackmailed and a shy bakeneko
* Those rarely happen, but sometimes she has some interactions with others where she ends up being mean just for the sake of it or possibly humilating the other person, something she seems to take sadistic glee in
* Loves pampering her cute little sister Akatai and really tries her best at being a great older sister to her!
* The pride and joy of her family, considered an exemplary and legendary kitsune even by others on their homeland
