**Minerva - vampire** {teacher}

> LiRe's legitimate crazy scientist who has already crossed way too many lines in her experiments, with stuff including fun and normal things like killing children or ruining all their chances at a functional life, all for the sake of the lofty goal of truth, science and her own ego. She's also one of Thana's biological moms and teaches magic and math at the Academy. Her current goal is undefined. Her past feats include turning her wife into as much of an immortal as her and managing to make a biological child of two women be possible. She is also a legitimate edgelord and wanted to honestly name Thana Thanatos.
