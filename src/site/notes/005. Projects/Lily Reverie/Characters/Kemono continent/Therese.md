The leader of humans, or at least the figure that comes the closest to being that. Rumored to be immortal, she has been around for a long, long time and has very strong magical powers, the extent of it also being a common source of rumors. One of the individuals in-charge of carrying executions, or at the very least supervising them.
Her role as the leader of humans is not a secret: humans know who she is, and so do the kemonos, although of course, they see her as the leader of those capable of magic instead.
Some people treat her akin to a deity. That said, there's also people who look at her with suspicion and suspect her behavior, even more so since her mana capacity seems to always be growing and she doesn't give off the most charismatic impression nor have much empathy.

# Personality 

Therese isn't much of a social type and tends to be no-nonsense, although calling her completely serious would be a bit too much. Just a bit.
Cold, closed-off and reserved, might ramble but overall very direct in communication. Puts a strong emphasis on fairness and justice (especially over mercy). Not very empathetic. Can behave intimidatingly.
Not much is known about her, despite her popularity.
